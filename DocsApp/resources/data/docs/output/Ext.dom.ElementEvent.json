The ElementEvent instance provides a single point for attaching event listeners\nand abstracts away important details on the timing and ordering of event firing.\nInternally this class manages up to 3 separate Ext.util.Event instances.  These represent\nseparate stacks of listeners that may be invoked during different phases of event propagation.\n\n- `captures` - tracks listeners that should fire during the \"capture\" phase of the\nstandard delegated model (listeners attached using capture:true)\n- `direct` - tracks directly attached listeners, that is listeners that should fire\nimmediately when the event is dispatched to the dom element, before the event bubbles\nupward and delegated listener processing begins\n(listeners attached using delegated:false)\n- `directCaptures` - tracks directly attached capture listeners (only works in IE10+)\n\nFor more detail on the timing of when these event stacks are dispatched please see\nExt.event.publisher.Dom\n",
