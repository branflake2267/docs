        "text": "Manages context information during a layout.\n\n# Algorithm\n\nThis class performs the following jobs:\n\n - Cache DOM reads to avoid reading the same values repeatedly.\n - Buffer DOM writes and flush them as a block to avoid read/write interleaving.\n - Track layout dependencies so each layout does not have to figure out the source of\n   its dependent values.\n - Intelligently run layouts when the values on which they depend change (a trigger).\n - Allow layouts to avoid processing when required values are unavailable (a block).\n\nWork done during layout falls into either a \"read phase\" or a \"write phase\" and it is\nessential to always be aware of the current phase. Most methods in\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout'>Ext.layout.Layout</a> are called during a read phase:\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a>,\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a> and\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finalizeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#finalizeLayout</a>. The exceptions to this are\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-beginLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#beginLayout</a>,\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-beginLayoutCycle'>Ext.layout.Layout#beginLayoutCycle</a> and\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#finishedLayout</a> which are called during\na write phase. While <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#finishedLayout</a> is called\na write phase, it is really intended to be a catch-all for post-processing after a\nlayout run.\n\nIn a read phase, it is OK to read the DOM but this should be done using the appropriate\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem'>Ext.layout.ContextItem</a> where possible since that provides a cache\nto avoid redundant reads. No writes should be made to the DOM in a read phase! Instead,\nthe values should be written to the proper ContextItem for later write-back.\n\nThe rules flip-flop in a write phase. The only difference is that ContextItem methods\nlike <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getStyle'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getStyle</a> will still read the DOM unless the\nvalue was previously read. This detail is unknowable from the outside of ContextItem, so\nread calls to ContextItem should also be avoided in a write phase.\n\nCalculating interdependent layouts requires a certain amount of iteration. In a given\ncycle, some layouts will contribute results that allow other layouts to proceed. The\ngeneral flow then is to gather all of the layouts (both component and container) in a\ncomponent tree and queue them all for processing. The initial queue order is bottom-up\nand component layout first, then container layout (if applicable) for each component.\n\nThis initial step also calls the beginLayout method on all layouts to clear any values\nfrom the DOM that might interfere with calculations and measurements. In other words,\nthis is a \"write phase\" and reads from the DOM should be strictly avoided.\n\nNext the layout enters into its iterations or \"cycles\". Each cycle consists of calling\nthe <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a> method on all layouts in the\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-property-layoutQueue'>layoutQueue</a>. These calls are part of a \"read phase\" and writes to the DOM should\nbe strictly avoided.\n\n# Considerations\n\n**RULE 1**: Respect the read/write cycles. Always use the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp</a>\nor <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp</a> methods to get calculated values;\nonly use the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getStyle'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getStyle</a> method to read styles; use\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp</a> to set DOM values. Some reads will, of\ncourse, still go directly to the DOM, but if there is a method in\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem'>Ext.layout.ContextItem</a> to do a certain job, it should be used instead\nof a lower-level equivalent.\n\nThe basic logic flow in <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a> consists of gathering\nvalues by calling <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp</a> or\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp</a>, calculating results and publishing\nthem by calling <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp</a>. It is important to realize\nthat <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp</a> will return <a href='#!/api/undefined'>undefined</a> if the value\nis not yet known. But the act of calling the method is enough to track the fact that the\ncalling layout depends (in some way) on this value. In other words, the calling layout is\n\"triggered\" by the properties it requests.\n\n**RULE 2**: Avoid calling <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp</a> unless the value\nis needed. Gratuitous calls cause inefficiency because the layout will appear to depend on\nvalues that it never actually uses. This applies equally to\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp</a> and the test-only methods\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-hasProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#hasProp</a> and <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-hasDomProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#hasDomProp</a>.\n\nBecause <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp</a> can return <a href='#!/api/undefined'>undefined</a>, it is often\nthe case that subsequent math will produce NaN's. This is usually not a problem as the\nNaN's simply propagate along and result in final results that are NaN. Both <a href='#!/api/undefined'>undefined</a>\nand NaN are ignored by <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp</a>, so it is often not necessary\nto even know that this is happening. It does become important for determining if a layout\nis not done or if it might lead to publishing an incorrect (but not NaN or <a href='#!/api/undefined'>undefined</a>)\nvalue.\n\n**RULE 3**: If a layout has not calculated all the values it is required to calculate, it\nmust set <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done'>Ext.layout.Layout#done</a> to `false` before returning from\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a>. This value is always `true` on entry because\nit is simpler to detect the incomplete state rather than the complete state (especially up\nand down a class hierarchy).\n\n**RULE 4**: A layout must never publish an incomplete (wrong) result. Doing so would cause\ndependent layouts to run their calculations on those wrong values, producing more wrong\nvalues and some layouts may even incorrectly flag themselves as <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done'>Ext.layout.Layout#done</a>\nbefore the correct values are determined and republished. Doing this will poison the\ncalculations.\n\n**RULE 5**: Each value should only be published by one layout. If multiple layouts attempt\nto publish the same values, it would be nearly impossible to avoid breaking **RULE 4**. To\nhelp detect this problem, the layout diagnostics will trap on an attempt to set a value\nfrom different layouts.\n\nComplex layouts can produce many results as part of their calculations. These values are\nimportant for other layouts to proceed and need to be published by the earliest possible\ncall to <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a> to avoid unnecessary cycles and poor performance. It is\nalso possible, however, for some results to be related in a way such that publishing them\nmay be an all-or-none proposition (typically to avoid breaking *RULE 4*).\n\n**RULE 6**: Publish results as soon as they are known to be correct rather than wait for\nall values to be calculated. Waiting for everything to be complete can lead to deadlock.\nThe key here is not to forget **RULE 4** in the process.\n\nSome layouts depend on certain critical values as part of their calculations. For example,\nHBox depends on width and cannot do anything until the width is known. In these cases, it\nis best to use <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-block'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#block</a> or\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#domBlock</a> and thereby avoid processing the layout\nuntil the needed value is available.\n\n**RULE 7**: Use <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-block'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#block</a> or\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#domBlock</a> when values are required to make progress.\nThis will mimize wasted recalculations.\n\n**RULE 8**: Blocks should only be used when no forward progress can be made. If even one\nvalue could still be calculated, a block could result in a deadlock.\n\nHistorically, layouts have been invoked directly by component code, sometimes in places\nlike an `afterLayout` method for a child component. With the flexibility now available\nto solve complex, iterative issues, such things should be done in a responsible layout\n(be it component or container).\n\n**RULE 9**: Use layouts to solve layout issues and don't wait for the layout to finish to\nperform further layouts. This is especially important now that layouts process entire\ncomponent trees and not each layout in isolation.\n\n# Sequence Diagram\n\nThe simplest sequence diagram for a layout run looks roughly like this:\n\n      Context         Layout 1     Item 1     Layout 2     Item 2\n         |               |           |           |           |\n    ---->X-------------->X           |           |           |\n    run  X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X beginLayout   |           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       A X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X  calculate    X---------->X           |           |\n         X             C X  getProp  |           |           |\n       B X               X---------->X           |           |\n         X               |  setProp  |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       D X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X  calculate    |           |           X---------->X\n         X               |           |           |  setProp  |\n       E X               |           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X completeLayout|           |         F |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       G X               |           |           |           |\n       H X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X  calculate    X---------->X           |           |\n         X             I X  getProp  |           |           |\n         X               X---------->X           |           |\n         X               |  setProp  |           |           |\n       J X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X completeLayout|           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       K X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X finalizeLayout|           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       L X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X finishedLayout|           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       M X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X notifyOwner   |           |           |           |\n       N |               |           |           |           |\n         -               -           -           -           -\n\n\nNotes:\n\n**A.** This is a call from the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-method-run'>run</a> method to the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-method-run'>run</a> method.\nEach layout in the queue will have its <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a>\nmethod called.\n\n**B.** After each <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a> method is called the\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done'>Ext.layout.Layout#done</a> flag is checked to see if the Layout has completed.\nIf it has completed and that layout object implements a\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a> method, this layout is queued to\nreceive its call. Otherwise, the layout will be queued again unless there are blocks or\ntriggers that govern its requeueing.\n\n**C.** The call to <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp</a> is made to the Item\nand that will be tracked as a trigger (keyed by the name of the property being requested).\nChanges to this property will cause this layout to be requeued. The call to\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp</a> will place a value in the item and not\ndirectly into the DOM.\n\n**D.** Call the other layouts now in the first cycle (repeat **B** and **C** for each\nlayout).\n\n**E.** After completing a cycle, if progress was made (new properties were written to\nthe context) and if the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-property-layoutQueue'>layoutQueue</a> is not empty, the next cycle is run. If no\nprogress was made or no layouts are ready to run, all buffered values are written to\nthe DOM (a flush).\n\n**F.** After flushing, any layouts that were marked as <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done'>Ext.layout.Layout#done</a>\nthat also have a <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a> method are called.\nThis can cause them to become no longer done (see <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-method-invalidate'>invalidate</a>). As with\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a>, this is considered a \"read phase\" and\ndirect DOM writes should be avoided.\n\n**G.** Flushing and calling any pending <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a>\nmethods will likely trigger layouts that called <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp</a>\nand unblock layouts that have called <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock'>Ext.layout.ContextItem#domBlock</a>.\nThese variants are used when a layout needs the value to be correct in the DOM and not\nsimply known. If this does not cause at least one layout to enter the queue, we have a\nlayout FAILURE. Otherwise, we continue with the next cycle.\n\n**H.** Call <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a> on any layouts in the queue\nat the start of this cycle. Just a repeat of **B** through **G**.\n\n**I.** Once the layout has calculated all that it is resposible for, it can leave itself\nin the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done'>Ext.layout.Layout#done</a> state. This is the value on entry to\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate'>Ext.layout.Layout#calculate</a> and must be cleared in that call if the\nlayout has more work to do.\n\n**J.** Now that all layouts are done, flush any DOM values and\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a> calls. This can again cause\nlayouts to become not done, and so we will be back on another cycle if that happens.\n\n**K.** After all layouts are done, call the <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finalizeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#finalizeLayout</a>\nmethod on any layouts that have one. As with <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a>,\nthis can cause layouts to become no longer done. This is less desirable than using\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout</a> because it will cause all\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finalizeLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#finalizeLayout</a> methods to be called again\nwhen we think things are all wrapped up.\n\n**L.** After finishing the last iteration, layouts that have a\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout'>Ext.layout.Layout#finishedLayout</a> method will be called. This\ncall will only happen once per run and cannot cause layouts to be run further.\n\n**M.** After calling finahedLayout, layouts that have a\n<a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-notifyOwner'>Ext.layout.Layout#notifyOwner</a> method will be called. This\ncall will only happen once per run and cannot cause layouts to be run further.\n\n**N.** One last flush to make sure everything has been written to the DOM.\n\n# Inter-Layout Collaboration\n\nMany layout problems require collaboration between multiple layouts. In some cases, this\nis as simple as a component's container layout providing results used by its component\nlayout or vise-versa. A slightly more distant collaboration occurs in a box layout when\nstretchmax is used: the child item's component layout provides results that are consumed\nby the ownerCt's box layout to determine the size of the children.\n\nThe various forms of interdependence between a container and its children are described by\neach components' <a href='#!/api/Ext.Component-method-getSizeModel'>Ext.Component#getSizeModel</a>.\n\nTo facilitate this collaboration, the following pairs of properties are published to the\ncomponent's <a href='#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem'>Ext.layout.ContextItem</a>:\n\n - width/height: These hold the final size of the component. The layout indicated by the\n   <a href='#!/api/Ext.Component-method-getSizeModel'>Ext.Component#getSizeModel</a> is responsible for setting these.\n - contentWidth/contentHeight: These hold size information published by the container\n   layout or from DOM measurement. These describe the content only. These values are\n   used by the component layout to determine the outer width/height when that component\n   is <a href='#!/api/Ext.Component-cfg-shrinkWrap'>Ext.Component#shrinkWrap</a>. They are also used to\n   determine overflow. All container layouts must publish these values for dimensions\n   that are shrink-wrapped. If a component has raw content (not container items), the\n   componentLayout must publish these values instead.\n",
