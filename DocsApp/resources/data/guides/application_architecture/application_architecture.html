<div class="contents"><p>#Introduction to Application Architecture</p>
<p>Ext JS provides support for both MVC and MVVM application architectures. Both of these 
architectural approaches share certain concepts and focus on dividing application code 
along logical lines. Each approach has its strengths based on how it chooses to divide 
up the pieces of an application.</p>
<p>The goal of this guide is to provide you with foundational knowledge regarding the 
components that make up these architectures. </p>
<p>##What is MVC?</p>
<p>In an MVC architecture, most classes are either Models, Views or Controllers. 
The user interacts with Views, which display data held in Models.  Those interactions 
are monitored by a Controller, which then responds to the interactions by updating the 
View and Model, as necessary. </p>
<p>The View and the Model are generally unaware of each other because the Controller has 
the sole responsibility of directing updates. Generally speaking, Controllers will 
contain most of the application logic within an MVC application. Views ideally have 
little (if any) business logic. Models are primarily an interface to data and contain 
business logic to manage changes to said data. </p>
<p>The goal of MVC is to clearly define the responsibilities for each class in the 
application. Because every class has clearly defined responsibilities, they implicitly 
become decoupled from the larger environment. This makes the app easier to test and 
maintain, and its code more reusable.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-application_architecture_-_what-is-mvvm-">What is MVVM?</h2>
<p>The key difference between MVC and MVVM is that MVVM features an abstraction of a View 
called the ViewModel. The ViewModel coordinates the changes between a Model’s data and 
the View&#39;s presentation of that data using a technique called “data binding”.</p>
<p>The result is that the Model and framework perform as much work as possible, minimizing 
or eliminating application logic that directly manipulates the View.</p>
<p>##Returning Users</p>
<p>Ext JS 5 introduces support for the MVVM architecture as well as improvements on the (C) 
in MVC. While we encourage you to investigate and take advantage of these improvements, 
it is important to note that we have made every effort to ensure existing Ext JS 4 MVC 
applications continue to function unmodified.</p>
<p>##MVC and MVVM
To understand how these choices fit into your application, we should start by further 
defining what the various abbreviations represent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>(M) Model</strong> - This is the data for your application. A set of classes (called 
“Models”) defines the fields for their data (e.g. a User model with user-name and 
password fields). Models know how to persist themselves through the data package and can 
be linked to other models via associations. </p>
<p>  Models are normally used in conjunction with Stores to provide data for grids and 
  other components.  Models are also an ideal location for any data logic that you may 
  need, such as validation, conversion, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>(V) View</strong> - A View is any type of component that is visually represented.  For 
instance, grids, trees and panels are all considered Views.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>(C) Controller</strong> - Controllers are used as a place to maintain the view&#39;s logic that 
makes your app work.  This could entail rendering views, routing, instantiating Models, 
and any other sort of app logic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>(VM) ViewModel</strong> - The ViewModel is a class that manages data specific to the View.<br>It allows interested components to bind to it and be updated whenever this data changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These application architectures provide structure and consistency to your framework 
code. Following the conventions we suggest will provide a number of important benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every application works in the same manner, so you only have to learn it once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#39;s easy to share code between applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can use <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/">Sencha Cmd</a> to create 
optimized production versions of your applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>##Building a Sample App</p>
<p>Before we start walking through the pieces, let&#39;s build a sample application 
with <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/">Sencha Cmd</a>.  First, download and 
unzip the <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/evaluate/">Ext JS SDK</a>.  Next, issue the 
following commands from your command line:</p>
<pre><code>sencha -sdk local/path/to/ExtJS generate app MyApp MyApp
cd app
sencha app watch
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are not familiar with what&#39;s happening above, please check out our 
<a href="../getting_started/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>.</p>
<p>##Application Overview
Before we start talking about the pieces that make up the MVC, MVVM, MVC+VM patterns, 
let&#39;s take a look at the structure of a Cmd generated application.</p>
<p>###File Structure
Ext JS applications follow a unified directory structure that is the same for every app. 
In our recommended layout, all Store, Model, ViewModel, and ViewController classes are 
placed in the <code>app</code> folder (<em>with Models placed in the <code>model</code> folder, Stores in 
<code>store</code>, and ViewModels/Controllers in <code>view</code></em>).  Best practice will be to logically 
group [[ext:Ext.app.ViewController ViewControllers]] and 
[[ext:Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModels]] together in sub-folders within the <code>app/view/</code> 
folder using a similar naming structure that you&#39;ll use for the views themselves (see 
the &quot;app/view/main/&quot; and &quot;classic/src/view/main/&quot; folders below). </p>
<p><img src="images/file_structure.jpeg"/></p>
<p>###Namespace
The first line of each Class is an address of sorts.  This &quot;address&quot; is called a 
namespace.  The formula for namespace is:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;AppName&gt;.&lt;foldername&gt;.&lt;ClassAndFileName&gt;
</code></pre><p>In your sample app, &quot;MyApp&quot; is the AppName, &quot;view&quot; is the folder name, &quot;main&quot; is the 
sub-folder name and &quot;Main&quot; is the Class and Filename.  Based on that information, the 
framework looks for a file called <code>Main.js</code> in the following location:</p>
<pre><code>// Classic
classic/src/view/main/Main.js

// Modern
modern/src/view/main/Main.js

// Core
// &quot;MyApp.view.main.MainController&quot; shared between toolkits would be located at:
app/view/main/MainController.js
</code></pre><p>If that file is not found, Ext JS will throw an error until you remedy the situation.</p>
<p><img src="images/missing_class_error.jpeg"/></p>
<p>##Application
Let’s start evaluating the application by looking at <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html manifest=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;MyApp&lt;/title&gt;


    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
        var Ext = Ext || {}; // Ext namespace won&#39;t be defined yet...

        // This function is called by the Microloader after it has performed basic
        // device detection. The results are provided in the &quot;tags&quot; object. You can
        // use these tags here or even add custom tags. These can be used by platform
        // filters in your manifest or by platformConfig expressions in your app.
        //
        Ext.beforeLoad = function (tags) {
            var s = location.search,  // the query string (ex &quot;?foo=1&amp;bar&quot;)
                profile;

            // For testing look for &quot;?classic&quot; or &quot;?modern&quot; in the URL to override
            // device detection default.
            //
            if (s.match(/\bclassic\b/)) {
                profile = &#39;classic&#39;;
            }
            else if (s.match(/\bmodern\b/)) {
                profile = &#39;modern&#39;;
            }
            else {
                profile = tags.desktop ? &#39;classic&#39; : &#39;modern&#39;;
                //profile = tags.phone ? &#39;modern&#39; : &#39;classic&#39;;
            }

            Ext.manifest = profile; // this name must match a build profile name

            // This function is called once the manifest is available but before
            // any data is pulled from it.
            //
            //return function (manifest) {
                // peek at / modify the manifest object
            //};
        };
    &lt;/script&gt;


    &lt;!-- The line below must be kept intact for Sencha Cmd to build your application --&gt;
    &lt;script id=&quot;microloader&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;bootstrap.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Ext JS uses the Microloader to load application resources described in the <code>app.json</code> 
file.  This replaces the need to add them to <code>index.html</code>.  With <code>app.json</code> all of the 
application meta-data exists in a single location.<br><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/">Sencha Cmd</a> can then compile your 
application in a simple and efficient manner.</p>
<p><code>app.json</code> is heavily commented and provides an excellent resource for gleaning 
information about the configuration it accepts.</p>
<p>For more information on the <code>beforeLoad</code> section and platform-specific builds refer to 
the <a href="../whats_new/6.0.0/developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments.html">Developing for Multiple Environments and Screens guide</a>.</p>
<p>###app.js
When we generated our application earlier, we created a class (in <code>Application.js</code>) AND 
launched an instance of it (in <code>app.js</code>).  You can see the content of <code>app.js</code> below:</p>
<pre><code>/*
 * This file is generated and updated by Sencha Cmd. You can edit this file as
 * needed for your application, but these edits will have to be merged by
 * Sencha Cmd when upgrading.
 */
Ext.application({
    name: &#39;MyApp&#39;,

    extend: &#39;MyApp.Application&#39;,

    requires: [
        &#39;MyApp.view.main.Main&#39;
    ],

    // The name of the initial view to create. With the classic toolkit this class
    // will gain a &quot;viewport&quot; plugin if it does not extend Ext.Viewport. With the
    // modern toolkit, the main view will be added to the Viewport.
    //
    mainView: &#39;MyApp.view.main.Main&#39;

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Most customizations should be made to MyApp.Application. If you need to
    // customize this file, doing so below this section reduces the likelihood
    // of merge conflicts when upgrading to new versions of Sencha Cmd.
    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
});
</code></pre><p>By designating a container class for [[ext:Ext.app.Application-cfg-mainView mainView]], 
you can use any class as your Viewport.  In the above example, we have determined 
<code>MyApp.view.main.Main</code> (an [[ext:Ext.tab.Panel TabPanel class]]) to be our Viewport.</p>
<p>The [[ext:Ext.app.Application-cfg-mainView mainView]] config instructs the application 
to create the designated view and attach the 
[[ext:Ext.plugin.Viewport Viewport Plugin]].  This connects the view to the document 
body.</p>
<p>###Application.js</p>
<p>Every Ext JS application starts with an instance of the 
[[ext:Ext.app.Application Application Class]].  This class is intended to be launch-able 
by <code>app.js</code> as well as instantiable for testing.</p>
<p>The following <code>Application.js</code> content is automatically created when you generate your 
application with Sencha Cmd. </p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.Application&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.Application&#39;,

    name: &#39;MyApp&#39;,

    stores: [
        // TODO: add global / shared stores here
    ],

    launch: function () {
        // TODO - Launch the application
    },

    onAppUpdate: function () {
        Ext.Msg.confirm(&#39;Application Update&#39;, &#39;This application has an update, reload?&#39;,
            function (choice) {
                if (choice === &#39;yes&#39;) {
                    window.location.reload();
                }
            }
        );
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The [[ext:Ext.app.Application Application Class]] contains global settings for your 
application, such as the app&#39;s namespace, shared stores, etc.  The <code>onAppUpdate</code> method 
is called when the application is out of date (<em>browser cached version versus the 
latest version on the server</em>).  The user is prompted to reload the application in order 
to operate with the current build.</p>
<p>##Views</p>
<p>A View is nothing more than a Component, which is a subclass of [[ext:Ext.Component]].<br>A view contains all of your application&#39;s visual aspects.</p>
<p>If you open the starter app&#39;s <code>classic/src/view/main/Main.js</code> file, you should see the 
following code.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.main.Main&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.tab.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;app-main&#39;,

        &#39;Ext.plugin.Viewport&#39;,
        &#39;Ext.window.MessageBox&#39;,

        &#39;MyApp.view.main.MainController&#39;,
        &#39;MyApp.view.main.MainModel&#39;,
        &#39;MyApp.view.main.List&#39;
    ],

        },
        wide: {

                    textAlign: &#39;center&#39;,
                    width: 120
                }
            }
        }
    },

    items: [{
        title: &#39;Home&#39;,
        iconCls: &#39;fa-home&#39;,
        // The following grid shares a store with the classic version&#39;s grid as well!
        items: [{
            xtype: &#39;mainlist&#39;
        }]
    }, {
        title: &#39;Users&#39;,
        iconCls: &#39;fa-user&#39;,
        bind: {
            html: &#39;{loremIpsum}&#39;
        }
    }, {
        title: &#39;Groups&#39;,
        iconCls: &#39;fa-users&#39;,
        bind: {
            html: &#39;{loremIpsum}&#39;
        }
    }, {
        title: &#39;Settings&#39;,
        iconCls: &#39;fa-cog&#39;,
        bind: {
            html: &#39;{loremIpsum}&#39;
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>Please note that the view does not include any application logic.  All of your view&#39;s 
logical bits should be included in the [[ext:Ext.app.ViewController ViewController]], 
which we&#39;ll talk about in the next section. </p>
<p>Two interesting pieces of this view are the <code>controller</code> and <code>viewModel</code> configs.</p>
<p>The next view of interest is the &quot;List&quot; view at <code>classic/src/main/view/List</code>.</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * This view is an example list of people.
 */
Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.main.List&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.grid.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;mainlist&#39;,

    requires: [
        &#39;MyApp.store.Personnel&#39;
    ],

    title: &#39;Personnel&#39;,

    store: {
        type: &#39;personnel&#39;
    },

    columns: [
        { text: &#39;Name&#39;,  dataIndex: &#39;name&#39; },
        { text: &#39;Email&#39;, dataIndex: &#39;email&#39;, flex: 1 },
        { text: &#39;Phone&#39;, dataIndex: &#39;phone&#39;, flex: 1 }
    ],

    listeners: {
        select: &#39;onItemSelected&#39;
    }
});
</code></pre><p>###Controller Config
The <code>controller</code> config allows you to designate a 
[[ext:Ext.app.ViewController ViewController]] for the view.  When a 
[[ext:Ext.app.ViewController ViewController]] is specified on a view in this manner, it 
then becomes a container for your event handlers and references.  This gives the 
[[ext:Ext.app.ViewController ViewController]] a one-to-one relationship with the 
components and events fired from the view.  We&#39;ll talk more about controllers in the 
next section.</p>
<p>###ViewModel Config
The <code>viewModel</code> config allows you to designate a [[ext:Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModel]] for 
the view.  The ViewModel is a data provider for this component and its child views. The 
data contained in the ViewModel is typically used by adding bind configs to the 
components that want to present or edit this data.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Main&quot; view, you can see that the header <code>title</code> of the main tabpanel is bound to 
the ViewModel.  This means that the <code>title</code> will be populated by data&#39;s &quot;name&quot; value, 
which is managed in the ViewModel.  If the ViewModel&#39;s data changes, the <code>title</code>&#39;s value 
will be automatically updated.  We&#39;ll discuss ViewModels later in this document.</p>
<p>##Controllers
Next, let&#39;s take a look at [[ext:Ext.app.ViewController Controllers]].  The starter 
app&#39;s generated ViewController <code>MainController.js</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.main.MainController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,

    alias: &#39;controller.main&#39;,

    onItemSelected: function (sender, record) {
        Ext.Msg.confirm(&#39;Confirm&#39;, &#39;Are you sure?&#39;, &#39;onConfirm&#39;, this);
    },

    onConfirm: function (choice) {
        if (choice === &#39;yes&#39;) {
            //
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>If you look back at your list view, <code>List.js</code>, you&#39;ll notice a function designation for the 
<code>grid</code>&#39;s select event.  That <code>handler</code> is mapped to a function called 
<code>onItemSelected</code> in the parent view, <code>Main.js</code>, controller.  As you can see, this 
controller is ready to deal with that event with no special setup.</p>
<p>This makes it incredibly easy to add logic for your application.  All you need to do is 
define the <code>onItemSelected</code> function since your controller has a one-to-one relationship 
with its view.</p>
<p>Upon selecting a grid row, a Message box will be created.  This message box contains 
its own function call with <code>onConfirm</code>, which is scoped to this same controller.</p>
<p>ViewControllers are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the connection to views using “listeners” and “reference” configs obvious.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leverage the life cycle of views to automatically manage their associated 
ViewController.  From instantiation to destruction, Ext.app.ViewController is tied to 
the component that referenced it. A second instance of the same view class would get its 
own ViewController instance.  When these views are destroyed, their associated 
ViewController instance will be destroyed as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide encapsulation to make nesting views intuitive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>##ViewModels
Next, let&#39;s take a look at the [[ext:Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModel]].  If you open your 
<code>app/view/main/MainModel.js</code> file, you should see the following code:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.main.MainModel&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewModel&#39;,

    alias: &#39;viewmodel.main&#39;,

    data: {
        name: &#39;MyApp&#39;,

        loremIpsum: &#39;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.&#39;
    }

    //TODO - add data, formulas and/or methods to support your view
});
</code></pre><p>A [[ext:Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModel]] is a class that manages a data object. This class 
then allows views interested in this data to bind to it and be notified of changes. The 
ViewModel, like ViewController, is owned by the view that references it. Because 
ViewModels are associated with a view, they are also able to link to a parent ViewModel 
owned by ancestor components in the component hierarchy. This allows child views to 
simply &quot;inherit&quot; the data of their parent ViewModel.</p>
<p>We created a linkage from our view to the ViewModel with the ViewModel config in 
&quot;Main.js&quot;.  This linkage allows binding of configs with setters to automatically set 
data from the viewModel onto the view in a declarative fashion.  The data is in-line in 
the &quot;MainModel.js&quot; example.  That said, your data could be anything and come from 
anywhere.  Data may be provided by any sort of proxy (AJAX, REST, etc).</p>
<p>##Models and Stores
[[ext:Ext.data.Model Models]] and [[ext:Ext.data.Store Stores]] make up the information 
gateway of your application.  Most of your data is sent, retrieved, organized, and 
&quot;modeled&quot; by these two classes.</p>
<p>###Models 
A [[ext:Ext.data.Model]] represents any type of persist-able data in your application. 
Each model has fields and functions that allow your application to &quot;model&quot; data. Models 
are most commonly used in conjunction with stores.  Stores can then be consumed by 
data-bound components like grids, trees, and charts.</p>
<p>Our sample application does not currently contain a model so let&#39;s add the following 
code:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.model.User&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
    fields: [
        {name: &#39;name&#39;,  type: &#39;string&#39;},
        {name: &#39;age&#39;,   type: &#39;int&#39;}
    ]
});
</code></pre><p>As mentioned in the namespace section above, you would want to create <code>User.js</code>, which will 
live under &quot;app/model/&quot;.</p>
<p>####Fields
[[ext:Ext.data.Model]] describes records that contain values or properties called 
“[[ext:Ext.data.Model-cfg-fields fields]]”. The Model class can declare these fields 
using the <code>fields</code> config. In this case, the <code>name</code> is declared to be a 
[[ext:Ext.data.field.String string]] and age is an 
[[ext:Ext.data.field.Integer integer]].  There are other 
[[ext:Ext.data.field.Field field types]] available in the API docs.  </p>
<p>While there are good reasons to declare fields and their types, doing so is not 
required.  If you do not include the fields config, data will be automatically read and 
inserted into the data object.  You will want to define your fields if your data needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Default values</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convert functions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s set up a store and see these two work together.</p>
<p>###Stores</p>
<p>A [[ext:Ext.data.Store Store]] is a client side cache of records (instances of a Model 
class). Stores provide functions for sorting, filtering and querying the records 
contained within.</p>
<p>This sample application does not contain a store, but not to worry.  Simply define your 
store and assign the Model.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.store.Users&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.data.Store&#39;,
    alias: &#39;store.users&#39;,
    model: &#39;MyApp.model.User&#39;,
    data : [
     {firstName: &#39;Seth&#39;, age: &#39;34&#39;},
     {firstName: &#39;Scott&#39;, age: &#39;72&#39;},
     {firstName: &#39;Gary&#39;, age: &#39;19&#39;},
     {firstName: &#39;Capybara&#39;, age: &#39;208&#39;}
    ]
});
</code></pre><p>Add the above content to <code>Users.js</code>, which should be placed in <code>app/store/</code>.</p>
<p>You can add the store to <code>Application.js</code>&#39;s store config if you&#39;d like a global instance 
of your store.  The stores config in <code>Application.js</code> would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>stores: [
    &#39;Users&#39;
],
</code></pre><p>In this example, the store directly contains the data.  Most real world situations 
would require that you gather data by using a proxy on your model or store.  Proxies 
allow for data transfer between your data providers and applications. </p>
<p>You can read more about models, stores, and data providers in our <a href="../core_concepts/data_package.html">Data Guide</a>.</p>
<p>##Next Steps</p>
<p>We&#39;ve created a robust and useful application called the 
<a href="http://dev.sencha.com/ext/5.0.0/examples/ticket-app/index.html">Ticket App</a>.  This 
application manages Login/Logout sessions, incorporates data binding, and displays 
&quot;best practice&quot; when utilizing an MVC+VM architecture.  This example has been heavily 
commented so that everything is as clear as possible.</p>
<p>We recommend you spend some time exploring the 
<a href="http://dev.sencha.com/ext/5.0.0/examples/ticket-app/index.html">Ticket App</a> to 
learn more about ideal MVC+VM Application Architecture.</p>
