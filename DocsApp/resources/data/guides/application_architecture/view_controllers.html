<p>Ext JS delivers some exciting improvements for you to use in your application 
architecture. We have added support for ViewModels and MVVM as well as ViewControllers 
to enhance MVC applications. Best of all, these choices are not mutually exclusive, so 
you can introduce these features incrementally or even blend them.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_application_level_controllers">Application-level Controllers</h2>
<p>A Controller is a class derived from [[ext:Ext.app.Controller]]. These Controllers use 
CSS-like selectors (called “Component Queries”) to match components and respond to their 
events. They also use “refs” to select and retrieve component instances.</p>
<p>These controllers are created at application launch and remain present for the life of 
the application. During its lifetime, views of interest to a controller will come and go. 
There may even be multiple instances of views that the controller manages.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>For large applications, these techniques can create certain challenges.</p>
<p>In such environments, views and controllers may be authored by multiple development 
teams and integrated into the final application. Ensuring that controllers only react to 
their intended views can be difficult. Further, it is common for developers to want to 
limit the number of controllers created at application launch. While lazily creating 
controllers is possible with some effort, they can’t be destroyed, so they remain even 
if they are no longer needed.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_viewcontrollers">ViewControllers</h2>
<p>While Ext JS 5+ is backwards compatible with legacy application-level controllers, it 
introduces a new type of controller designed to handle these challenges: 
[[ext:Ext.app.ViewController]]. ViewController does this in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifies the connection to views using “listeners” and “reference” configs.</li>
<li>Leverages the life cycle of views to automatically manage their associated 
ViewController.</li>
<li>Reduces complexity in the ViewController based on a one-to-one relationship with the 
managed view.</li>
<li>Provides encapsulation to make nesting views reliable.</li>
<li>Retains the ability to select components and listen to their events at any level below 
the associated view.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_listeners">Listeners</h3>
<p>For the purposes of ViewControllers, we can look at just two examples. The first is a 
basic use of a listeners config on a child item in a view:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;textfield&#39;,
        fieldLabel: &#39;Bar&#39;,
        listeners: {
            change: &#39;onBarChange&#39;  // no scope given here
        }
    }]
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onBarChange: function (barTextField) {
        // called by &#39;change&#39; event
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The above use of listeners shows a named event handler (<code>onBarChange</code>) with no specified 
“scope”. Internally, the event system resolves the default scope for the Bar textfield 
to its owning ViewController.</p>
<p>Historically, the listeners config was reserved for use by a component’s creator, so how 
would a view listen to its own events, or perhaps those fired by its base class? The 
answer is that we need to use an explicit scope:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    listeners: {
        collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;,
        scope: &#39;controller&#39;
    },

    items: [{
        ...
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>The above example leverages two new features in Ext JS: named scopes and declarative 
listeners. We’ll focus on the named scope here. There are two valid values for named 
scope: “this” and “controller”. When writing MVC applications, we almost always use 
“controller” which has the obvious result of looking on that view’s ViewController (not 
the ViewController of the view that created the instance).</p>
<p>Since a view is a type of [[ext:Ext.Component]], we have assigned this view an “xtype” 
which enables other views to create an instance of our view in the same way this view 
created its textfield. To see how this comes together, consider a view that uses this 
one. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.bar.Bar&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;bar&#39;,
    controller: &#39;bar&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
        listeners: {
            collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>In this case, the Bar view is creating an instance of the Foo view as one of its items. 
Further, it is listening to the collapse event just like the Foo view. The listeners 
declared by the Foo view will fire on Foo’s ViewController while the listeners declared 
in the Bar view will fire on Bar’s ViewController.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_reference">Reference</h3>
<p>One of the most common loose ends when writing controller logic is getting ahold of the 
necessary components to complete a particular action. Something as simple as:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    tbar: [{
        xtype: &#39;button&#39;,
        text: &#39;Add&#39;,
        handler: &#39;onAdd&#39;
    }],

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;grid&#39;,
        ...
    }]
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onAdd: function () {
        // ... get the grid and add a record ...
    }
});
</code></pre><p>But how should one acquire the grid component? All techniques require you to place some 
recognizable property on the grid to allow it to be uniquely identified. Older 
techniques used the “id” config (and [[ext:Ext.getCmp]]) or the “itemId” config (using 
“refs” or some component query method). The advantage of “id” is fast lookup, but since 
these identifiers must be unique across the entire application and the DOM as well, this 
is not often desirable. Using “itemId” and some form of query is more flexible, but it’s 
necessary to perform a search to find the desired component.</p>
<p>Using the <code>reference</code> config, we simply add the “reference” to the grid and use 
<code>lookupReference</code> to get at it:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    tbar: [{
        xtype: &#39;button&#39;,
        text: &#39;Add&#39;,
        handler: &#39;onAdd&#39;
    }],

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;grid&#39;,
        reference: &#39;fooGrid&#39;
        ...
    }]
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onAdd: function () {
        var grid = this.lookupReference(&#39;fooGrid&#39;);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>This is similar to assigning an itemId of “fooGrid” and doing: “this.down(‘#fooGrid’)”. 
The difference under the hood, however, is quite significant. First, a reference config 
instructs the component to register itself with its owning view (identified by the 
presence of a ViewController in this case). Second, the <code>lookupReference</code> method simply 
consults the cache to see if references need to be refreshed (say due to add or remove 
on a container). If all is well, it just returns the reference from the cache. Or, 
in pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>lookupReference: (reference) {
    var cache = this.references;
    if (!cache) {
        Ext.fixReferences(); // fix all references
        cache = this.references; // now the cache is valid
    }
    return cache[reference];
}
</code></pre><p>In other words, there is no search and the linkages damaged by adding or removing items 
from containers are fixed in one go, when they are needed. As we will see below, this 
approach has benefits other than efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>
<p>The use of selectors along with the controller <code>refs</code> config was very flexible, but at 
the same time had certain risks. The fact that these selectors “see” everything at all 
levels of the component hierarchy is both powerful and prone to mistakes. For example, a 
controller could be working 100% when it runs in isolation but then fails as soon as 
other views are introduced because its selectors have undesired matches with the new 
view.</p>
<p>These problems can be managed by following certain practices, but when using listeners 
and references with a ViewController these problems are simply not possible. This is 
because the listeners and reference configs connect only with their owning 
ViewController. Views are free to chose any reference value that is unique within that 
view knowing that these names will not be exposed to the view’s creator.</p>
<p>Likewise, listeners are resolved on their owning ViewController and cannot be 
accidentally dispatched to event handlers in other controllers with errant selectors. 
While listeners are often preferable to selectors, the two mechanisms play well together 
for those situations where a selector-based approach is desired.</p>
<p>To complete this model, views need to fire events that can be consumed by their owning 
view’s ViewController. There is a helper method in ViewController for this purpose: 
<code>fireViewEvent</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onAdd: function () {
        var record = new MyApp.model.Thing();
        var grid = this.lookupReference(&#39;fooGrid&#39;);
        grid.store.add(record);

        this.fireViewEvent(&#39;addrecord&#39;, this, record);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>This enables the standard form of listener for the creator of this view:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.bar.Bar&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;bar&#39;,
    controller: &#39;bar&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
        listeners: {
            collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;,
            addrecord: &#39;onAddRecord&#39;
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_listeners_and_event_domains">Listeners and Event Domains</h3>
<p>In Ext JS 4.2, the MVC event dispatcher was generalized with the introduction of event 
domains. These event domains intercepted events as they were fired and dispatched them 
to controllers controlled by selector matching. The “component” event domain had full 
component query selectors while the other domains had more limited selectors.</p>
<p>With Ext JS 5+, each ViewController creates an instance of a new type of event domain 
called the “view” event domain. This event domain allows ViewControllers to use the 
standard <code>listen</code> and <code>control</code> methods while limiting their scope implicitly to their 
view. It also adds a special selector to match the view itself:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    control: {
        &#39;#&#39;: {  // matches the view itself
            collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;
        },
        button: {
            click: &#39;onAnyButtonClick&#39;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The key difference between listeners and selectors can be seen above. The “button” 
selector will match any button in this view or any child view, irrespective of depth, 
even if that button belongs to a great-grandchild view. In other words, selector-based 
handlers do not respect encapsulation boundaries. This behavior is consistent with 
previous [[ext:Ext.app.Controller]] behavior and can be a useful technique in limited 
situations.</p>
<p>Lastly, these event domains respect nesting and effectively “bubble” an event up the 
view hierarchy. That is to say, when an event fires, it’s first delivered to any 
standard listeners. Then, it’s delivered to its owning ViewController, followed by its 
parent ViewController (if any) on up the hierarchy. Eventually, the event is delivered 
to the standard “component” event domain to be handled by Ext.app.Controller-derived 
controllers.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_life_cycle">Life cycle</h3>
<p>A common technique with large applications is to dynamically create controllers when 
they are first needed. This could help reduce the load time of the application and help 
runtime performance as well by not activating all potential controllers. The limitation 
to this in previous versions was that, once created, these controllers would remain 
active in the application. It was not possible to destroy them and release their 
resources. Likewise, this did not change the reality that a controller could have any 
number of associated views (including none).</p>
<p>The ViewController, however, is created very early in the component’s lifecycle and is 
bound to that view for its entire lifetime. When that view is destroyed, the 
ViewController is likewise destroyed. This means that the ViewController is no longer 
forced to manage states where there is no view or many views.</p>
<p>This one-to-one relationship means reference tracking is simplified and no longer prone 
to leaking destroyed components. A ViewController can implement any of these methods to 
perform tasks at key points in its lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>beforeInit - This method can be overridden in order to operate on the view prior to 
its initComponent method being called. This method is called immediately after the 
controller is created, which occurs during initConfig called from the Component 
constructor.</li>
<li>init - Called shortly after initComponent has been called on the view. This is the 
typical time to perform initialization for the controller now that the view is 
initialized.</li>
<li>initViewModel - Called when the view’s ViewModel is created (if one is defined).</li>
<li>destroy - Cleanup and return resources (be sure to call <code>callParent</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We think ViewControllers will greatly streamline your MVC applications. They also work 
very well with ViewModels, so you can combine these approaches and their respective 
strengths. We’re excited about the upcoming release and seeing these improvements at 
work in your applications.</p>
