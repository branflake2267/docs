<p>Data binding and the ViewModel that powers it are powerful additions to Ext JS.<br>Together they enable you to do more with less code and write in a much more declarative
style while helping you maintain a clean separation of concerns.</p>
<p>A ViewModel is a class that manages a data object. It then allows those interested in 
this data to bind to it and be notified when it changes. The ViewModel, like 
ViewController, is owned by the view that references it.  Because ViewModels are 
associated with a view, they are also able to link to a parent ViewModel owned by 
ancestor components in the component hierarchy. This allows child views to simply 
&quot;inherit&quot; the data of their parent ViewModel.</p>
<p>Components have a <code>bind</code> config that allows them to associate many of their configs to 
data from the ViewModel. Using bind, you can be sure that the appropriate component 
config will have its setter method called whenever the bound value changes - no custom 
event handlers needed.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will walk through some examples that show the power of ViewModels and
Data Binding.</p>
<p>##Component Binding</p>
<p>Probably the best way to understand binding and ViewModels is to look at the various 
ways you can use bindings on components. This is because components are the primary 
consumers of data binding and components are something familiar to Ext JS developers. 
In order for binding to work, however, we do need a ViewModel so we will reference one 
for now and define it later.</p>
<p>###Binding and Configs</p>
<p>Binding for components is the process of connecting data from a 
[[ext:Ext.app.ViewModel]] to a component&#39;s config properties. Any configuration a 
component possesses may be bound to, so long as it has a setter method. For instance, 
since there&#39;s a <code>setTitle()</code> method on [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]], you can bind to the 
<code>title</code> configuration.</p>
<p>In this example, we will set the <code>width</code> of a panel based on the results of our 
ViewModel&#39;s <code>data</code>.  We can bind our data to <code>width</code> since <code>setWidth()</code> is a method that 
<code>Ext.panel.Panel</code> may use.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;, {
    title: &#39;Simple Form&#39;,

    viewModel: {
        type: &#39;test&#39;  // we will define the &quot;test&quot; ViewModel soon
    },

    bind: {
        html: &#39;&lt;p&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/p&gt;&#39;,
        width: &#39;{someWidth}&#39;
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The syntax used for bind values is very similar to [[ext:Ext.Template]]. You can put 
text around tokens inside braces. You can use formatters as well, as with 
<code>Ext.Template</code>. Unlike <code>Ext.Template</code>, however, when a template is a single token (like 
&#39;{someWidth}&#39;) then its value is passed unmodified. That is, it is not converted to a 
string.</p>
<p>We will see later how the data for <code>name</code> and <code>someWidth</code> are defined. The above example
simply shows how the data is consumed by a component.</p>
<p>###Binding Boolean Configs</p>
<p>Many configs you will want to bind are boolean values, such as visible (or <code>hidden</code>),
<code>disabled</code>, <code>checked</code>, and <code>pressed</code>. Bind templates support boolean negation &quot;inline&quot; 
in the template. Other forms of algebra are relegated to formulas (see below), but 
boolean inversion is common enough there is special provision for it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;, {
    title: &#39;Simple Form&#39;,

    viewModel: {
        type: &#39;test&#39;
    },

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;button&#39;,
        bind: {
            hidden: &#39;{!name}&#39;  // negated
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>This also highlights how values in single token templates are not converted to strings. 
In the above, while &quot;name&quot; is a string value, it is negated using &quot;!&quot; and becomes a 
boolean value and that is passed to the <code>setHidden</code> method on the button.</p>
<p>###Binding and Priority</p>
<p>Bound config properties will always overwrite configurations set statically on the
component as soon as the bound result is available. In other words, bound data will 
always take priority over static configuration values but may be delayed in order to 
fetch that data.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;, {
    title: &#39;Simple Form&#39;,

    viewModel: {
        type: &#39;test&#39;
    },

    bind: {
        title: &#39;Hello {name}&#39;
    }
});
</code></pre><p>Once the binding for &quot;name&quot; is delivered, the &quot;Simple Form&quot; title will be replaced.</p>
<p>###Binding and Child Components</p>
<p>One of the most helpful parts of binding is that all of the children of the component 
with a viewModel also have access to their container&#39;s data.</p>
<p>In this example, you can see the children items of a form may be bound to their
container&#39;s viewModel.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;, {
    title: &#39;Simple Form&#39;,

    viewModel: {
        type: &#39;test&#39;
    },

    layout: &#39;form&#39;,
    defaultType: &#39;textfield&#39;,

    items: [{
        fieldLabel: &#39;First Name&#39;,
        bind: &#39;{firstName}&#39; // uses &quot;test&quot; ViewModel from parent
    },{
        fieldLabel: &#39;Last Name&#39;,
        bind: &#39;{lastName}&#39;
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>###Two Way Binding</p>
<p>The bind config also allows for two-way data binding, which translates to live
synchronization of data between the view and the model.  Any data change made in the 
view is automatically written back to the model.  This automatically updates any other
components that may be bound to that same data.
<strong>Note:</strong> Not all configs will publish their value to the ViewModel when changed.<br>Configs defined within the <code>publish</code> and <code>twoWayBindable</code> array will publish changes 
back up to the ViewModel.  Values may also be published in Component / application logic 
using the <code>publishState</code> method.</p>
<p>In the above example, because the &quot;firstName&quot; and &quot;lastName&quot; properties were bound to 
text fields, changes in the input would be written back to the ViewModel. To see how all 
this connects, it is time to complete the example and define the ViewModel.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.TestViewModel&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewModel&#39;,

    alias: &#39;viewmodel.test&#39;, // connects to viewModel/type below

    data: {
        firstName: &#39;John&#39;,
        lastName: &#39;Doe&#39;
    },

    formulas: {
        // We&#39;ll explain formulas in more detail soon.
        name: function (get) {
            var fn = get(&#39;firstName&#39;), ln = get(&#39;lastName&#39;);
            return (fn &amp;&amp; ln) ? (fn + &#39; &#39; + ln) : (fn || ln || &#39;&#39;);
        }
    }
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.TestView&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    layout: &#39;form&#39;,

    // Always use this form when defining a view class. This
    // allows the creator of the component to pass data without
    // erasing the ViewModel type that we want.
    viewModel: {
        type: &#39;test&#39;  // references alias &quot;viewmodel.test&quot;
    },

    bind: {
        title: &#39;Hello {name}&#39;
    },

    defaultType: &#39;textfield&#39;,
    items: [{
        fieldLabel: &#39;First Name&#39;,
        bind: &#39;{firstName}&#39;
    },{
        fieldLabel: &#39;Last Name&#39;,
        bind: &#39;{lastName}&#39;
    },{
        xtype: &#39;button&#39;,
        text: &#39;Submit&#39;,
        bind: {
            hidden: &#39;{!name}&#39;
        }
    }]
});

Ext.onReady(function () {
    Ext.create(&#39;MyApp.view.TestView&#39;, {
        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),
        width: 400
    });
});
</code></pre><p>When the above panel is displayed we can see that changes in the text fields are 
reflected in the panel <code>title</code> as well as the <code>hidden</code> state of the &quot;Submit&quot; button.</p>
<p>###Binding and Component State</p>
<p>Sometimes a component&#39;s state, e.g. the <code>checked</code> state of a checkbox or the selected
record of a grid, is interesting to other components. When a component is assigned a
<code>reference</code> to identify it, that component will publish some of its key properties in 
the ViewModel.</p>
<p>In this example, we have the &quot;Admin Key&quot; textfield&#39;s disabled config bound to the the
checked state of the checkbox. This results in the textfield being disabled until the
checkbox is checked. This sort of behavior is well suited for dynamic forms like this:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;, {
    title: &#39;Sign Up Form&#39;,

    viewModel: {
        type: &#39;test&#39;
    },

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;checkbox&#39;,
        boxLabel: &#39;Is Admin&#39;,
        reference: &#39;isAdmin&#39;
    },{
        xtype: &#39;textfield&#39;,
        fieldLabel: &#39;Admin Key&#39;,
        bind: {
            disabled: &#39;{!isAdmin.checked}&#39;
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>###Bind Descriptors
So far we&#39;ve seen three basic forms of bind descriptors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>{firstName}</code> - A &quot;direct bind&quot; to some value in the ViewModel. This value is passed
through unmodified and so may arrive as any type of data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Hello {name}</code> - A &quot;bind template&quot; always produces a string by inserting the textual
value of the various bind expressions. Bind templates can also use formatters as with a
normal <code>Ext.Template</code>, for example: &#39;Hello {name:capitalize}&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>{!isAdmin.checked}</code> - The negated form of a direct bind, useful for binding to 
boolean config properties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these basic forms, there are a few specialized forms of bind descriptors that you
can use.</p>
<p>####Multi-Bind</p>
<p>If an object or array is given as a bind descriptor, the ViewModel will produce an 
object or array of the same shape but with the various properties replaced by their bind 
result.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.Component&#39;, {
    bind: {
        data: {
            fname: &#39;{firstName}&#39;,
            lname: &#39;{lastName}&#39;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>This sets the &quot;data&quot; config for the component to be an object with two properties whose
values are set from the ViewModel.</p>
<p>####Record Bind
When a particular record is desired, say &quot;User&quot; with <code>id</code> of 42, the bind descriptor is 
an object but with a &quot;reference&quot; property. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.Component&#39;, {
    bind: {
        data: {
            reference: &#39;User&#39;,
            id: 42
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>In this case, the component&#39;s <code>tpl</code> will receive the User record once it is loaded. This
currently requires the use of an <code>Ext.data.Session</code>.</p>
<p>####Association Bind
Similar to a record bind, one can also bind to an association, say the User&#39;s Address
record:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.Component&#39;, {
    bind: {
        data: {
            reference: &#39;User&#39;,
            id: 42,
            association: &#39;address&#39;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>In this case, the component&#39;s <code>tpl</code> will receive the User&#39;s &quot;address&quot; record once it is
loaded. This also currently requires the use of an <code>Ext.data.Session</code>.</p>
<p>####Bind Options
The final form of bind descriptor is used when you need to describe binding options. The
following example shows how to receive only one value for a binding and then disconnect
automatically.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.Component&#39;, {
    bind: {
        data: {
            bindTo: &#39;{name}&#39;,
            single: true
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The <code>bindTo</code> property is the second reserved name in a bind descriptor object (the first
being <code>reference</code>). When present, it signifies that the value of <code>bindTo</code> is the actual
bind descriptor and the other properties are configuration options for the binding.</p>
<p>The other bind option currently supported is <code>deep</code>. This option is used when binding to
an object so that the binding will be notified when any property of that object changes,
not just the reference itself. This would be most useful when binding to the <code>data</code> 
config of a component since these often receive objects.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.create(&#39;Ext.Component&#39;, {
    bind: {
        data: {
            bindTo: &#39;{someObject}&#39;,
            deep: true
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>##Creating ViewModels
Now that we&#39;ve gotten a taste for how components use ViewModels and gotten a glimpse of
what ViewModels look like, it is time to learn more about ViewModels and what they offer.</p>
<p>As stated previously, a ViewModel is a manager for an underlying <code>data</code> object. It is 
the content of that object that is being consumed by bind statements. The inheritance of 
data from a parent ViewModel to its child ViewModels leverages the JavaScript prototype 
chain.  This is covered in more detail in the 
<a href="./view_model_internals.html">View Model Internals</a> guide, but in a nutshell a child 
ViewModel&#39;s <code>data</code> object has the <code>data</code> object of its parent ViewModel as its 
prototype.</p>
<p>###Formulas</p>
<p>In addition to holding data and providing binding, ViewModels also offer a convenient 
way to calculate data from other data called <code>formulas</code>.  Formulas allow you to 
encapsulate data dependencies in the ViewModel and keep your views free to focus on 
declaring their structure. </p>
<p>In other words, the data is not changed in the ViewModel&#39;s data, but can be displayed
differently by transforming it using formulas. This is similar to how the <code>convert</code>
configuration works for fields of a traditional data model.</p>
<p>We saw a simple &quot;name&quot; formula in the previous example.  In that case, the &quot;name&quot; 
formula was simply a function that combined two other values from the ViewModel: 
&quot;firstName&quot; and &quot;lastName&quot;.</p>
<p>Formulas can also use the results of other formulas as if the result were just another
data property. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.TestViewModel2&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewModel&#39;,

    alias: &#39;viewmodel.test2&#39;,

    formulas: {
        x2y: function (get) {
            return get(&#39;x2&#39;) * get(&#39;y&#39;);
        },

        x2: function (get) {
            return get(&#39;x&#39;) * 2;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The &quot;x2&quot; formulas uses an &quot;x&quot; property to define &quot;x2&quot; as &quot;x * 2&quot;. The &quot;x2y&quot; formulas 
uses both &quot;x2&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. This definition means that if &quot;x&quot; changes, &quot;x2&quot; is recalculated 
and then &quot;x2y&quot;. But if &quot;y&quot; changes, only &quot;x2y&quot; needs to be recalculated.</p>
<p>####Formulas With Explicit Binding</p>
<p>In the above examples, the dependencies for the formula were found via inspecting the 
function, however this isn&#39;t always the best solution. An explicit bind statement can be 
used, which will return a simple object when all the values in the bind have presented.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.TestViewModel2&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewModel&#39;,

    alias: &#39;viewmodel.test2&#39;,

    formulas: {
        something: {
            bind: {
                x: &#39;{foo.bar.x}&#39;,
                y: &#39;{bar.foo.thing.zip.y}&#39;
            },

            get: function (data) {
                return data.x + data.y;
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>####Two-Way Formulas</p>
<p>When a formula is invertible we can also define a <code>set</code> method to be called when the 
value is set (say via two-way binding). Since the &quot;this&quot; pointer is the ViewModel, the 
<code>set</code> method can call <code>this.set()</code> to set the appropriate properties in the ViewModel.</p>
<p>A revised version of the TestViewModel below shows how &quot;name&quot; can be defined as a 
two-way formula.</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.TestViewModel&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewModel&#39;,

    alias: &#39;viewmodel.test&#39;,

    formulas: {
        name: {
            get: function (get) {
                var fn = get(&#39;firstName&#39;), ln = get(&#39;lastName&#39;);
                return (fn &amp;&amp; ln) ? (fn + &#39; &#39; + ln) : (fn || ln || &#39;&#39;);
            },

            set: function (value) {
                var space = value.indexOf(&#39; &#39;),
                    split = (space &lt; 0) ? value.length : space;

                this.set({
                    firstName: value.substring(0, split),
                    lastName: value.substring(split + 1)
                });
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>###Recommendations</p>
<p>With all the power of ViewModels, formulas, and data binding, it can be easy to overuse 
or abuse these mechanisms and create an application that is hard to understand or debug, 
or is slow to update or leaks memory. To help avoid these issues and still get the most 
out of ViewModels here are some recommended techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Always use the following form when configuring your viewModel.</strong> This is important
because of the way the Config System merges config values. With this form, the &quot;type&quot;
property is preserved during the merge.</p>
<pre><code>  Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.TestView&#39;, {
      //...
      viewModel: {
          type: &#39;test&#39;
      },
  });
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Make names obvious</strong>, especially in high level ViewModels. In JavaScript we rely on
textual searching so pick names that make finding usages possible. The more code that
might use a property the more important it is to pick meaningful or even unique names.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t nest data in objects more deeply than necessary.</strong> Multiple top-level objects 
stored in the ViewModel will require less bookkeeping compared to one object with lots 
of nested sub-objects. Further, this will help make dependencies on this information 
more obvious than if many components depend on some large containing object. There are 
reasons to share objects, but remember the ViewModel is just a managed object so you can 
use its properties too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use child ViewModels to allow data to be cleaned up</strong> with the components that 
needed it.  If you put all data in high-level ViewModels, that data will likely never be 
removed even when the child views that needed it have been destroyed. Instead, create 
ViewModels for the child view and pass data into its ViewModel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t create child ViewModels unless they are actually needed.</strong> Each ViewModel
instance takes time to create and memory to manage. If a child view does not need data
unique to itself, it can simply use the ViewModel it inherits from its container. See 
the previous recommendation though, because it is better to create child ViewModels when 
they are needed than pollute a parent ViewModel and effectively leak memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use formulas instead of repeating binds.</strong> If you followed how formulas are ways to
combine the results of several bound values you can probably see how using a formula 
would help reduce the number of dependencies compared to directly using those same 
values in many places. For example, one formula with 3 dependencies and 4 users make 
<code>3 + 4 = 7</code> dependencies to track in the ViewModel. Compared to 4 users with those 3 
dependencies on themselves we would have <code>3 * 4 = 12</code> dependencies. Fewer dependencies 
to track means less memory used and time to process them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t chain formulas too deeply.</strong> This is not so much a run-time cost issue as a 
code clarity issue. Chained formulas can mask the connections between data and 
components making it hard to understand what is happening.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Two-way formulas must be stable.</strong> Say formula &quot;foo&quot; is a calculation of value 
&quot;bar&quot;.  When &quot;foo&quot; is set it will set &quot;bar&quot; by inverting the formula from its get 
method. The result is stable if the get method will produce the exact same value for 
&quot;foo&quot; that is now being set. If it does not, the process will cycle until it reaches a 
stable point or it will continue indefinitely. Neither result is likely desirable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
