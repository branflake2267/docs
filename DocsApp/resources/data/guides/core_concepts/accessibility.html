<p>Ext JS 5.0.1+ makes it possible to create highly accessible JavaScript applications by 
providing the tools that developers need to achieve <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">ARIA compliance</a>. Ext JS 
makes it easy for application developers to create UIs that are usable by people using assistive 
technologies to navigate the web.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_overview_of_accessibility">Overview of Accessibility</h2>
<p>What does software accessibility mean? In general, accessibility means that the functionality 
and content of an application is available and navigable to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those with disabilities, especially the visually impaired</li>
<li>Those who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to use a computer</li>
<li>Those who cannot use a mouse to navigate an application</li>
<li>Power users that prefer keystrokes over mouse clicks</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1998, the United States Congress passed the &quot;<a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a>&quot;, 
more commonly known as &quot;Section 508&quot;. Section 508 requires Federal agencies to make all 
electronic information readily available to people with disabilities. Section 508 
accessibility is a requirement for anyone producing applications for U.S. government agencies. </p>
<p>However, accessibility is beneficial to all applications since the additional features enable 
them to reach a larger number of users. Web applications can make significant steps toward 
achieving compliance with Section 508 by following the guidelines spelled out in the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative&#39;s</a> &quot;Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite&quot;, 
otherwise known as <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA</a> or just &quot;ARIA&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_accessibility_in_ext_js">Accessibility in Ext JS</h2>
<p>Thanks to Ext JS&#39;s built-in tab indexing and focus-ability, your browser should tab and 
focus as you would expect. With this approach, we are able to translate components into 
items that the browser understands for default keyboard navigable behavior.</p>
<p>Accessibility support in Ext JS is designed with two major goals in mind: keyboard 
navigation via focus and DOM attributes. </p>
<p>As of Ext JS 5.0.1, the focus and keyboard navigation functionality is &quot;always on&quot; due to 
the class-level property known as <code>focusable</code>. This allows all keyboard enabled components 
to interact with the user when tabbed into.  </p>
<p>What this all really means is that focus is part of every application without any additional 
modifications needed by the developer.</p>
<h3 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_focus_styling">Focus styling</h3>
<p>Focus styling is a method of visually indicating that an element is 
prepared to accept keyboard events or other user inputs. This is valuable (and necessary) 
for accessibility and power users that heavily rely upon keyboard navigation.</p>
<p>The framework provides a clear indication of the currently focused component, which updates 
as the focused component is changed. This indication will generally be seen as an inner 
border and/or body border on the focused element. This may vary slightly depending on your 
application&#39;s theme. To give you control over these visual aspects, you may modify<br>multiple SASS variables and mixin parameters related to focus.</p>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_buttons">Buttons</h4>
<p>In previous releases, button focus styling was identical to hover styling.  It tended to be a source 
of confusion for some users.  In 5.0.1+, we  changed buttons to use &quot;inner&quot; bordering to 
indicate focus.  This takes the form of a 1px solid border 
directly inside the button&#39;s outer border in Neptune and Crisp themes.</p>
<p><img src="images/crisp_button.jpeg"/></p>
<p>In Classic themes, the focus border is rendered as a dotted outline around the Button&#39;s 
inner element, similar to the classic &quot;Windows&quot; look.</p>
<p><img src="images/classic_button.jpeg"/></p>
<p>You may need to control the styling of a focused button when it is hovered or 
pressed separately from the default hover state.  To accommodate this, we&#39;ve added SASS 
variables for 2 additional button states - &quot;focus-over&quot; and &quot;focus-pressed&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_tabs">Tabs</h4>
<p>Tabs have not historically had a visual indication of focus. In Ext JS 5.0.1+, 
Tabs are treated similarly to Buttons.  Focus comes in the form of a solid inner border in 
Neptune/Crisp themes and a dotted body outline in Classic.</p>
<p>Crisp:</p>
<p><img src="images/crisp_tab.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Classic:</p>
<p><img src="images/classic_tab.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Just as with Buttons, Tabs have SASS variables for controlling two additional 
focus states - &quot;focus-over&quot; and &quot;focus-active&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_grids">Grids</h4>
<p>The focused grid cell also contains a distinct focus border as seen below:</p>
<p><img src="images/row_focus.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, grid column headers can also be independently focused as seen below:</p>
<p><img src="images/header_focus.jpeg"/></p>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_customizing_focus_styling">Customizing Focus Styling</h4>
<p>We expect support for keyboard navigation to be a welcome change for many 
applications, making them more accessible to more users.  At the same time, we understand 
that all applications have different needs and requirements. In some cases, the default 
focus styling may not be desired, so we have provided the ability to customize the focus 
styling of any component using a robust API of SASS variables and mixins.</p>
<p>All of the variables having to do with focus styling will have the word &quot;focus&quot; in their name, 
so they should be easy to locate in the documentation.  Simply navigate to 
the class documentation for the component you wish to style and scroll down to 
the &quot;CSS Variables&quot; section.  </p>
<p>For example, to style the color of the focus border for the &quot;default&quot; button UI, one would 
use the <code>$button-default-inner-border-color-focus</code> SASS variable.  For more information 
on how to use SASS in your application please refer to the 
<a href="./theming.html">Theming Guide</a></p>
<h3 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_keyboard_navigation">Keyboard Navigation</h3>
<p>Your application&#39;s focusable components are fully navigable using the keyboard without 
mouse interaction. In terms of Ext JS, this means that pressing tab key will advance focus 
beginning with the URL bar to the next focusable item within your application document&#39;s body. </p>
<p>However, certain containers such as toolbars have slightly different behavior.  The tab key will 
advance focus between toolbars and arrow keys will move focus within the toolbar. This is 
how WAI-ARIA standards helps to ensure better usability by avoiding the need to press 
tab key excessively.</p>
<p>For this example, let&#39;s look at two toolbars containing multiple buttons, which are an 
example of focusable items. </p>
<p><img src="images/tabbars.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Tabbing into &quot;Toolbar 1&quot; will focus &quot;Button 1&quot; as seen above. Continued tabbing will 
advance focus to the next component containing a focusable item. In this case, the next 
focusable item, &quot;Button A&quot;, lives within &quot;Toolbar 2&quot;. Focusable items may be buttons, 
tabs, form fields, grids, etc.</p>
<p>Alternatively, &quot;shift + tab&quot; will follow the tabindex in reverse order, abiding by the same 
rules as above. As an example, performing a &quot;shift + tab&quot; within &quot;Toolbar 2&quot; will return 
focus to &quot;Toolbar 1&quot;.</p>
<p>Upon entering one of the above toolbars, you may also use your arrow keys to navigate between 
buttons. Your arrow keys will loop through all of the buttons within the toolbar. Upon 
reaching &quot;Button 4&quot;, focus will loop back to &quot;Button 1&quot;.</p>
<p>If you use your tab key to leave a toolbar, and then &quot;shift + tab&quot; back to said toolbar, 
the framework will restore focus to the previously focused button. This creates a form of 
state within your toolbar and other focusable containers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Upon entering an input field, arrow key navigation will only operate within said 
field. tab or shift-tab key press will then be necessary to exit the field.</p>
<h3 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_dom_attributes">DOM attributes</h3>
<p>A Component&#39;s DOM elements should use attributes that provide semantic information regarding 
the elements&#39; type, state, and description. These attributes are used by assistive technologies, 
such as screen readers, to provide verbal cues to the user and can be categorized into 
two separate groups:</p>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_aria_roles">ARIA Roles</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles">ARIA roles</a> are the main indicator of a Component or 
Element&#39;s type. Roles are constant and do not change as the user interacts with a 
Component. The most commonly used ARIA Roles in Ext JS are Widget Roles. Many of these 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#widget_roles">Widget Roles</a> directly correspond to Ext JS 
components. Some examples of widget roles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toolbars</li>
<li>Tab bars and tabs</li>
<li>Checkboxes</li>
<li>Radio Buttons</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Breadcrumb Groups</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_aria_states_and_properties">ARIA States and Properties</h4>
<p>DOM attributes are attributes that may change in response to user interaction or application 
state. An example of an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties">ARIA State</a> is the 
&quot;aria-checked&quot; attribute that is applied to a checkbox component when it is checked by the 
user. Likewise, an example of an ARIA Property is the &quot;aria-invalid&quot; property of a form field, 
which may be dynamically changed based on validation or user input.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll talk about enabling ARIA States and Properties in the ARIA package section below.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_aria_package">ARIA Package</h2>
<p>As of Ext JS 6+, ARIA functionality integrates directly into the component life-cycle. 
This means you won’t need a special “aria” package to get correct ARIA behavior. 
Applications will now support screen readers (like JAWS) without the need for special 
inclusion.</p>
<p>However, in Ext JS 5, the &quot;ext-aria&quot; package is a separate Cmd package that provides support for 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties">ARIA States and Properties</a>. The 
&#39;ext-aria&#39; package should be included in the Sencha Cmd generated <code>app.json</code> file&#39;s 
<code>requires</code> block like any other package.  </p>
<p>For instance: </p>
<pre><code>&quot;requires&quot;: [
    &quot;ext-aria&quot;
],
</code></pre><p>Once you&#39;ve modified your application&#39;s <code>app.json</code> file, simply rebuild the application.  After 
building, your components will contain the ARIA states and properties described above.</p>
<p>That said, it is not necessary to directly require the ARIA package if your are 
utilizing &quot;ext-theme-aria&quot; in Ext JS 5 or &quot;theme-aria&quot; in Ext JS 6.  The ARIA theme requires the ARIA package by 
default.  We&#39;ll discuss implementing ARIA theme in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you&#39;re not familiar with building an application as described above, please 
visit our <a href="../getting_started/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_aria_theme">ARIA Theme</h2>
<p>The ARIA theme is a high-contrast theme that makes applications easier for visually 
impaired users to view. It can be used out of the box or extended to create a customized 
look and feel.</p>
<p>To incorporate the Ext JS ARIA theme into your application, simply modify the <code>theme</code> 
block in <code>app.json</code>.</p>
<p>The default theme setting should become one of the following:</p>
<p>Ext JS 5</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * The name of the theme for this application.
 */
&quot;theme&quot;: &quot;ext-theme-aria&quot;,
</code></pre><p>Ext JS 6</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * The name of the theme for this application.
 */
&quot;theme&quot;: &quot;theme-aria&quot;,
</code></pre><p>Once you&#39;ve modified your application&#39;s <code>app.json</code> file, simply refresh the application. The 
application should be utilizing the ARIA theme theme as seen below:</p>
<p><img src="images/aria_theme.jpeg"/></p>
<p>For information about custom theming, please check out the Ext JS Theming Guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you&#39;re not familiar with building an application as described above, please 
visit our <a href="../getting_started/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-accessibility_-_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ext JS 5.0.1+ contains core functionality to support accessibility with 
our new focus and keyboard navigation additions. The ARIA package (included by default in Ext JS 6) and ARIA theme 
provides you with a much simpler path to creating an accessible application. We are working 
towards expanding functionality to provide more robust accessibility support in future releases.</p>
