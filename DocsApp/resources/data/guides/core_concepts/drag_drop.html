<p>One of the most powerful interaction design patterns available to developers is &quot;Drag and
Drop.&quot; We utilize Drag and Drop without really giving it much thought - especially when
its done right. Here are 5 easy steps to ensure an elegant implementation.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_defining_drag_and_drop">Defining drag and drop</h2>
<p>A drag operation, essentially, is a click gesture on some UI element while the mouse
button is held down and the mouse is moved. A drop operation occurs when the mouse button
is released after a drag operation. From a high level, drag and drop decisions can be
summed up by the following flow chart.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_drag_logic.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>To speed up our development, Ext JS provides us with the Ext.dd classes to manage the
basic decisions for us. In this guide, we will cover coding for the appearance and removal
of the drop invitation, invalid drop repair and what happens when a successful drop
occurs.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_organizing_the_drag_and_drop_classes">Organizing the drag and drop classes</h2>
<p>A first glance of the classes in the Ext.dd documentation might seem a bit intimidating. 
But, if we take a quick moment to look at the classes, we see that they all stem from the
DragDrop class and most can be categorized into Drag or Drop groups.  With a bit more time
and digging, we can see that the classes can be further categorized into single node and
multiple node drag or drop interactions.</p>
<p><img src='images/diagram.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>In order to learn about the basics of drag and drop we&#39;ll focus on applying single drag
and drop interactions to DOM nodes.  To do this, we&#39;ll utilize the DD and DDTarget
classes, which provide the base implementations for their respective drag and drop
behaviors. However, we need to discuss what our objectives are before we can start
implementing drag and drop.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_the_task_at_hand">The task at hand</h2>
<p>Lets say we&#39;ve been asked to develop an application that will provide a rental car company
the ability to place their cars and trucks in one of three states:  available, rented or
in repair status.  The cars and trucks are only allowed to be placed in their respective
&quot;available&quot; container.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_story.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>To get started, we must make the cars and trucks &quot;dragable&quot;. For this, we&#39;ll use DD. We&#39;ll
need to make the rented, repair and vehicle containers &quot;drop targets&quot;.  For this we&#39;ll use
DDTarget.  Lastly, we&#39;ll use different drag drop groups to help enforce the requirement
that cars and trucks can only be dropped into their respective &quot;available&quot; containers. Now
we can begin coding by adding drag operations to the cars and trucks.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_1_starting_with_drag">Step 1: Starting with drag</h2>
<p>To configure the vehicle DIVs elements as dragable, we&#39;ll need to obtain a list and loop
through it to instantiate new instances of DD.  Here&#39;s how we do it.</p>
<pre><code>    Ext.onReady(function() {
        // Create an object that we&#39;ll use to implement and override drag behaviors a little later

        var overrides = {};

        // Configure the cars to be draggable
        var carElements = Ext.get(&#39;cars&#39;).select(&#39;div&#39;);
        Ext.each(carElements.elements, function(el) {
            var dd = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DD&#39;, el, &#39;carsDDGroup&#39;, {
                isTarget  : false
            });
            //Apply the overrides object to the newly created instance of DD
            Ext.apply(dd, overrides);
        });

        var truckElements = Ext.get(&#39;trucks&#39;).select(&#39;div&#39;);
        Ext.each(truckElements.elements, function(el) {
            var dd = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DD&#39;, el, &#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;, {
                isTarget  : false
            });
            Ext.apply(dd, overrides);
        });
    });
</code></pre><p>All drag and drop classes are designed to be implemented by means of overriding its
methods. That&#39;s why in the above code segment, we have create an empty object called
overrides, which will be filled in later with overrides specific to the action we need. We
get of list of car and truck elements by leveraging the DomQuery select method to query
the cars container for all the child div elements. To make the cars and truck elements
dragable, we create a new instance of DD, passing in the car or truck element to be
dragged and the drag drop group that it is to participate in. Notice that the vehicle
types have their own respective drag drop group. This will be important to remember later
when we setup the rented and repair containers as drop targets. Also notice that we&#39;re
applying the overrides object to the newly created instances of DD using Ext.apply., which
is a handy way to add properties or methods to an existing object. Before we can continue
with our implementation, we need to take a quick moment to analyze what happens when you
drag an element on screen. With this understanding, the rest of the implementation will
fall into place.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_peeking_at_how_drag_nodes_are_affected">Peeking at how drag nodes are affected</h2>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll notice when dragging the car or truck elements around is that they
will stick wherever they are dropped. This is OK for now because we&#39;ve just begun our
implementation. What is important is to understand how the drag nodes are being affected.
This will aid us in coding for the return to their original positions when they are dropped 
on anything that is not a valid drop target, which is known as an &quot;invalid drop&quot;. The
below illustration uses FireBug&#39;s HTML inspection panel and highlights the changes being
made by when a drag operation is applied to the Camaro element.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_inspection.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>While inspecting the drag element during a drag operation, we can see a style attribute
added to the element with three CSS values populated: position, top and left. Further
inspection reveals that the position attribute set to relative and top and left attributes
updating while the node is being dragged around. After a the drag gesture completes, the
style attribute remains along with the styles contained therein. This is what we have to
clean up when we code for the repair of an invalid drop. Until we setup proper drop
targets, all drop operations are considered invalid.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_2_repairing_an_invalid_drop">Step 2: Repairing an invalid drop</h2>
<p>The path of least resistance is to repair an invalid drop by reseting the style attribute
that is applied during the drag operation. This means that the drag element would
disappear from under the mouse and reappear where it originated and would be quite boring.
To make it smoother, we&#39;ll use Ext.Fx to animate this action. Remember that the drag and
drop classes were designed to have methods overridden. To implement repair, we&#39;ll need to
override the b4StartDrag, onInvalidDrop and endDrag methods. Lets add the following
methods to our overrides object above and we&#39;ll discuss what they are and do.</p>
<pre><code>    var overrides = {
        // Called the instance the element is dragged.
        b4StartDrag : function() {
            // Cache the drag element
            if (!this.el) {
                this.el = Ext.get(this.getEl());
            }

            //Cache the original XY Coordinates of the element, we&#39;ll use this later.
            this.originalXY = this.el.getXY();
        },
        // Called when element is dropped in a spot without a dropzone, or in a dropzone without matching a ddgroup.
        onInvalidDrop : function() {
            // Set a flag to invoke the animated repair
            this.invalidDrop = true;
        },
        // Called when the drag operation completes
        endDrag : function() {
            // Invoke the animation if the invalidDrop flag is set to true
            if (this.invalidDrop === true) {
                // Remove the drop invitation
                this.el.removeCls(&#39;dropOK&#39;);

                // Create the animation configuration object
                var animCfgObj = {
                    easing   : &#39;elasticOut&#39;,
                    duration : 1,
                    scope    : this,
                    callback : function() {
                        // Remove the position attribute
                        this.el.dom.style.position = &#39;&#39;;
                    }
                };

                // Apply the repair animation
                this.el.setXY(this.originalXY[0], this.originalXY[1], animCfgObj);
                delete this.invalidDrop;
            }
        },
</code></pre><p>In the above code, we begin by overriding the b4StartDrag method, which is called the
instant the drag element starts being dragged around screen and makes it an ideal place to
cache the drag element and original XY coordinates - which we will use later on in this
process. Next, we override onInvalidDrop, which is is called when a drag node is dropped
on anything other than a drop target that is participating in the same drag drop group.
This override simply sets a local invalidDrop property to true, which will be used in the
next method. The last method we override is endDrag, which is called when the drag element
is no longer being dragged around screen and the drag element is no longer being
controlled by the mouse movements. This override will move the drag element back to its
original X and Y position using animation. We configured the animation to use the
elasticOut easing to provide a cool and fun bouncy effect at end of the animation.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_camaro_repair.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>OK, now we have the repair operation complete. In order for it to work on the drop
invitation and valid drop operations, we need to setup the drop targets.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_3_configuring_the_drop_targets">Step 3: Configuring the drop targets</h2>
<p>Our requirements dictate that we will allow cars and trucks to be in be dropped in the
rented and repair containers as well as their respective original containers. To do this,
we&#39;ll need to instantiate instances of the DDTarget class. Here&#39;s how its done.</p>
<pre><code>// Instantiate instances of Ext.dd.DDTarget for the cars and trucks container
var carsDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;cars&#39;,&#39;carsDDGroup&#39;);
var trucksDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;trucks&#39;, &#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;);

// Instantiate instances of DDTarget for the rented and repair drop target elements
var rentedDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;rented&#39;, &#39;carsDDGroup&#39;);
var repairDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;repair&#39;, &#39;carsDDGroup&#39;);

// Ensure that the rented and repair DDTargets will participate in the trucksDDGroup
rentedDDTarget.addToGroup(&#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;);
repairDDTarget.addToGroup(&#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;);
</code></pre><p>In the above code snippet, we have setup drop targets for the cars, trucks, rented and
repair elements. Notice that the cars container element only participates in the
&quot;carsDDGroup&quot; and the trucks container element participates in the &quot;trucksDDGroup&quot;. This
helps enforce the requirement that cars and trucks can only be dropped in their
originating container. Next, we instantiate instances DDTarget for the rented and repair
elements. Initially, they are configured to only participate in the &quot;carsDDGroup&quot;. In
order to allow them to participate in the &quot;trucksDDGroup&quot;, we have to add it by means of
addToGroup. OK, now we&#39;ve configured our drop targets. Lets see what happens when we drop
the cars or trucks on a valid drop element.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_drops_no_onDragDrop.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>In exercising the drop targets, we see that the drag element stays exactly its dropped.
That is, images can be dropped anywhere on a drop target and stay there. This means that
our drop implementation is not complete. To complete it, we need to actually code for the
&quot;complete drop&quot; operation, by means of another override for the instances of DD that we
created some time ago.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_4_completing_the_drop">Step 4: Completing the drop</h2>
<p>To complete the drop, we will need to actually drag the element from its parent element to
the drop target element using DOM tools. This is accomplished by overriding the DD
onDragDrop method. Add the following method to the overrides object.</p>
<pre><code>var overrides = {
    ...
    // Called upon successful drop of an element on a DDTarget with the same
    onDragDrop : function(evtObj, targetElId) {
        // Wrap the drop target element with Ext.Element
        var dropEl = Ext.get(targetElId);

        // Perform the node move only if the drag element&#39;s
        // parent is not the same as the drop target
        if (this.el.dom.parentNode.id != targetElId) {

            // Move the element
            dropEl.appendChild(this.el);

            // Remove the drag invitation
            this.onDragOut(evtObj, targetElId);

            // Clear the styles
            this.el.dom.style.position =&#39;&#39;;
            this.el.dom.style.top = &#39;&#39;;
            this.el.dom.style.left = &#39;&#39;;
        }
        else {
            // This was an invalid drop, initiate a repair
            this.onInvalidDrop();
        }
    },
</code></pre><p>In the above override, the drag element is moved to the drop target element, but only if
it is not the same as the drag element&#39;s parent node. After the drag element is moved, the
styles are cleared from it. If the drop element is the same as the drag element&#39;s parent,
we ensure a repair operation occurs by calling this.onInvalidDrop.</p>
<p><img src='images/drag_and_drop_working_without_invitation.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>Upon a successful drop, the drag elements will now will be moved from their parent element
to the drop target. How does the user know if they are hovering above a valid drop target?
We&#39;ll give the user some visual feedback by configuring the drop invitation.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_5_adding_drop_invitation">Step 5: Adding drop invitation</h2>
<p>In order to make drag and drop a bit more useful, we need to provide feedback to the user
on whether or not a drop operation can successfully occur. This means that we&#39;ll have to
override the onDragEnter and onDragOut methods Add these last two methods to the overrides
object.</p>
<pre><code>    var overrides = {
        ...
        // Only called when the drag element is dragged over the a drop target with the
same ddgroup
        onDragEnter : function(evtObj, targetElId) {
            // Colorize the drag target if the drag node&#39;s parent is not the same as the
drop target
            if (targetElId != this.el.dom.parentNode.id) {
                this.el.addCls(&#39;dropOK&#39;);
            }
            else {
                // Remove the invitation
                this.onDragOut();
            }
        },
        // Only called when element is dragged out of a dropzone with the same ddgroup
        onDragOut : function(evtObj, targetElId) {
            this.el.removeCls(&#39;dropOK&#39;);
        }
    };
</code></pre><p>In the above code, we override the onDragEnter and onDragOut methods, both of which are
only utilized when the drag element is interacting with a drop target participating in the
same drag drop group. The onDragEnter method is only called when the mouse cursor first
intersects the boundaries of a drop target while a drag item is in drag mode. Likewise,
onDragOut is called when the mouse cursor is first dragged outside the boundaries of the
drop target while in drag mode.</p>
<p><img src='images/drag_and_drop_working_with_invitation.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>By adding overrides to the onDragEnter and onDragOut methods we can see that the
background of the drag element will turn green when the mouse cursor first intersects a
valid drop target and will lose its green background when it leaves the drop target or is
dropped. This completes our implementation of drag and drop with DOM elements.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_it_doesn_t_stop_here">It doesn&#39;t stop here</h2>
<p>Drag and drop can be a can be applied to mostly everything in the Ext JS framework. Here
are a few examples that you can use to learn how to implement drag and drop with various
widgets:</p>

<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Today, we learned how to implement end to end drag and drop of DOM nodes using the
first-level drag and drop implementation classes. From a high-level, we defined and
discussed what drag and drop is and how to think about it in terms of the framework. We
also learned that the drag and drop classes can be grouped by drag or drop behaviors and
whether or not they support single or multiple drag or drop operations. While implementing
this behavior, we illustrated that the dd classes help make some of the behavioral
decisions, and that we are responsible for coding the end-behaviors. We hope you&#39;ve
enjoyed this thorough look at some fundamental drag and drop operations with DOM nodes. We
look forward to bringing you more articles about this topic in the future.</p>
