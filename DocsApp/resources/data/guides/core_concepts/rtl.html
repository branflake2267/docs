<div class="contents"><p>#Right-to-Left Support in Ext JS</p>
<p>Ext JS has an extensive locale library with support for over 40 languages from around 
the world.  Some of these languages are read from right to left. This makes right-to-left (RTL) 
support a must.  Combining Ext JS&#39;s localization package with RTL support gives your 
application a voice for the entire globe.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will walk through enabling RTL support for your application.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To enable localization in your application, please check out the Ext JS 
<a href="./localization.html">locale guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-rtl_-_rtl_with_sencha_cmd">RTL with Sencha Cmd</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start by generating an application using Sencha Cmd.  Simply open your terminal and
issue the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sencha generate app -ext MyApp ./app
cd app
sencha app watch
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are not familiar with what is happening above, please check out our 
<a href="../getting_started/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="core_concepts-_-rtl_-_enabling_rtl">Enabling RTL</h3>
<p>It&#39;s incredibly simple to enable RTL in your Cmd generated app.  All you need to do is 
require <code>Ext.rtl.*</code> and set <code>rtl: true</code>.  </p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.main.Main&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.container.Container&#39;,
    requires: [
        &#39;Ext.rtl.*&#39;
    ],
    rtl: true,
    ...
</code></pre><p>In the case of our generated application, you would add the above code to your <code>Main.js</code>. 
This can be found in your <code>app/view/main</code> folder.  This is the designated Viewport in this 
instance.  If you are not using the generated application, you may also add it to your 
top level container or Viewport. </p>
<p>Upon adding the above code snippet, you can then rebuild your application:</p>
<pre><code>sencha app build
</code></pre><p>Once you refresh your application, you should see that your page elements are flipped 
horizontally and your text is written from right to left.</p>
<p>All children of your top level container with <code>rtl: true</code> will inherit the same 
functionality.  You may indicate <code>rtl:false</code> on a child element to disable RTL for that 
particular piece of your application.</p>
<h3 id="core_concepts-_-rtl_-_locales_with_rtl">Locales with RTL</h3>
<p>Using locales with RTL, such as Hebrew, will flip your application to RTL by default in 
the near future.  However, at this time, that functionality is tied to Viewport and is not 
activated when using <code>mainView</code> with a container other than [[ext:Ext.container.Viewport]].  </p>
<p>In this case, you can enable RTL for your application as mentioned above.</p>
<p>However, you may not want to hardcode RTL support into your application if you are 
incorporating multiple locales.  In this case, you would need to add a locale override for 
the language in your application&#39;s root directory.</p>
<h4 id="core_concepts-_-rtl_-_rtl_locale_override">RTL Locale Override</h4>
<p>In this section, we will discuss adding an override for the Hebrew locale.  This same logic
will apply for any other locale needing an override for dynamic RTL support.  You would 
simply replace the &quot;he&quot; with your locale&#39;s abbreviation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a folder named &quot;locale&quot; in the root of your application.  This 
would appear at the same level as the app, build, ext, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a folder with your locale&#39;s abbreviation inside of the locale folder.  In this
case, we will create a folder called &quot;he&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a file called <code>Viewport.js</code> inside of your &quot;he&quot; folder.  The resulting file
structure should look similar to this:</p>
<p> <img src="images/locale-override-filesystem.jpg"/></p>
<p> You can then add the following override to your <code>Viewport.js</code> override file:</p>
<pre><code> Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.locale.he.Viewport&#39;, {
     override: &#39;Ext.plugin.Viewport&#39;,
     requires: &#39;Ext.rtl.*&#39;,
     setCmp: function (cmp) {

         this.callParent([cmp]);

         cmp.rtl = true;
     }    
 })
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now that your override is in place you&#39;ll need to alert <code>app.json</code> to its presence so 
that Cmd recognizes the override and compiles it within your next build.  Add the following 
line to your <code>app.json</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;overrides&quot;: &quot;${app.dir}/overrides,${app.dir}/locale/${app.locale},
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>This will tell Cmd that it should utilize any file located within your application&#39;s 
overrides and locale folder.</p>
<p>With this override in place, you should be better equipped to generate an application that
supports multiple locales without having to hardcode RTL support into your parent container.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-rtl_-_rtl_without_sencha_cmd">RTL without Sencha Cmd</h2>
<p>While we encourage users to utilize the powerful tools within Sencha Cmd, we recognize 
that some folks are not able to use Sencha Cmd.   This portion of the guide will walk you 
through setting up RTL support without using Sencha Cmd.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Update your <code>index.html</code> file to point to your particular flavor of RTL framework file, 
included with all Ext JS framework downloads after Ext JS 4.2.0.  For example:</p>
<pre><code> build/ext-all-rtl-debug.js
 build/ext-all-rtl.js
</code></pre><p> This will modify your application to load the RTL-specific library.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update your index.html file to point to your selected theme&#39;s RTL CSS file, included 
with all Ext JS framework downloads after Ext JS 4.2.0.  The default location for these 
live here:</p>
<pre><code>build/packages/ext-theme-{themename}/build/resources/ext-theme-{themename}-all-rtl.css
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Lastly, add <code>rtl: true</code> to your Viewport</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a sample index.html file using Neptune with RTL support enabled:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Hello RTL&lt;/title&gt;

        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;build/packages/ext-theme-neptune/build/resources/ext-theme-neptune-all-rtl.css&quot;&gt;
        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/releases/extjs/5.0.0/build/ext-all-rtl.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;build/packages/ext-theme-neptune/build/ext-theme-neptune.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        &lt;script&gt;

            Ext.application({
                name: &#39;MyApp&#39;,
                launch: function() {

                    Ext.create(&#39;Ext.container.Viewport&#39;, {
                        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),
                        rtl : true,
                        html: &quot;hello I am a bunch of text&quot;
                    });              

                }
            });

        &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
