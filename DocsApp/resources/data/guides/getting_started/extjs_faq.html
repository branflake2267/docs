<p>Below you&#39;ll find answers to the most commonly asked questions regarding Ext JS.  If you
can&#39;t find an answer to your question, please visit the Ext JS forums or file a
Support ticket.</p>
<p>If you believe that your question warrants addition to this page, please let us know!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following FAQ&#39;s apply to Ext 5 and higher unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_what_browsers_does_ext_js_support_">What browsers does Ext JS Support?</h3>
<h4 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_desktop">Desktop</h4>
<ul>
<li>IE8+ (standards mode only)</li>
<li>Firefox (PC &amp; Mac)</li>
<li>Safari 6+</li>
<li>Chrome (PC &amp; Mac)</li>
<li>Opera (PC &amp; Mac)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_touch_screen">Touch Screen</h4>

<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_what_doctype_should_i_use_">What Doctype should I use?</h3>
<p>We recommend using the HTML5 doctype. To ensure that Internet Explorer does not activate
Compatibility Mode (<em>compatibility mode is unsupported</em>), we also recommend using the 
<code>X-UA-Compatible</code> meta tag. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre><h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_can_i_build_an_application_without_sencha_cmd_">How can I build an application without Sencha Cmd?</h3>
<p>You can build an application without Sencha Cmd by including the Framework, theme CSS,
and your chosen theme&#39;s JS override in your <code>index.html</code> file&#39;s head.</p>
<p>The theme&#39;s CSS and override files are created as packages in Ext JS.  In Ext JS 5 the 
themes are located within &quot;{ExtJS-5-SDK}/packages/&quot;.  Themes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ext-theme-base (<em>used by the framework and should not be configured directly</em>)</li>
<li>ext-theme-neutral (<em>used when creating custom themes and should not be configured directly</em>)</li>
<li>ext-theme-classic</li>
<li>ext-theme-gray</li>
<li>ext-theme-neptune</li>
<li>ext-theme-neptune-touch (<em>optimized for tablets</em>)</li>
<li>ext-theme-crisp</li>
<li>ext-theme-crisp-touch (<em>optimized for tablets</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ext JS 6 the themes are split between the classic and modern toolkits.  The classic 
themes are located within &quot;{ExtJS-6-SDK}/classic/&quot; and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>theme-base (<em>used by the framework and should not be configured directly</em>)</li>
<li>theme-neutral (<em>used when creating custom themes and should not be configured directly</em>)</li>
<li>theme-classic</li>
<li>theme-gray</li>
<li>theme-neptune</li>
<li>theme-neptune-touch (<em>optimized for tablets</em>)</li>
<li>theme-crisp</li>
<li>theme-crisp-touch (<em>optimized for tablets</em>)</li>
<li>theme-triton</li>
</ul>
<p>Ext JS 6 modern themes are located within &quot;{ExtJS-6-SDK}/modern/&quot; and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>theme-base (<em>used by the framework and should not be configured directly</em>)</li>
<li>theme-blackberry</li>
<li>theme-cupertino</li>
<li>theme-cupertino-classic</li>
<li>theme-mountainview</li>
<li>theme-neptune</li>
<li>theme-windows</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  We do recommend using Sencha Cmd, as the above example includes a very large 
file that includes everything.  When using Sencha Cmd, your application only gets the 
bits it requires, which keeps it lightweight, responsive, and clean.</p>
<p>The <a href="./getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a> will walk you through generating 
your application using Sencha Cmd.</p>

<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_can_i_change_my_application_s_theme_without_using_sencha_cmd_">How can I change my application&#39;s theme without using Sencha Cmd?</h3>
<p>To set an application&#39;s theme, simply include the theme package&#39;s CSS and JS override in
your <code>index.html&#39;s</code> head.  As an example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;ext/packages/ext-theme-neptune/build/resources/ext-theme-neptune-all.css&quot;&gt;
        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;ext/build/ext-all-debug.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;ext/packages/ext-theme-neptune/build/ext-theme-neptune.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre><h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_can_i_write_a_single_application_for_both_desktop_and_ipad_">Can I write a single application for both Desktop and iPad?</h3>
<p>Yes, any Ext JS 5 application should properly appear on desktop AND tablets or 
touch-screen devices with supported browsers.  It should be noted that there are 
generally no extra steps necessary for tablet support.</p>
<p>That said, there are two areas that may need some attention in specific situations.  The
first will not affect developers who only use Ext JS API event listeners.  However, if 
you are directly attaching listeners, or you are using a 3rd party JavaScript library 
that directly attaches listeners, issues may occur with the timing of directly attached 
event handlers.  This has to do with some changes made to the event system in order to 
support touch gestures.</p>
<p>You can find more information about changes regarding event delegation in our
<a href="../core_concepts/events.html">events guide</a> and our
<a href="../core_concepts/tablet_support.html">tablet support guide</a>.</p>
<p>The second scenario deals with mouse events that don&#39;t have an obvious analog in the 
touch world.  For instance, there are no touch equivalents for mouseover, mouseout, 
mousenter, or mouseleave.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to provide an alternate implementation for these interactions if 
that functionality is critical to your application. This often means substituting the 
mouse event with an appropriate touch gesture.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_if_ext_js_5_works_with_tablets_why_shouldn_t_i_use_it_for_smart_phones_as_well_">If Ext JS 5 works with tablets, why shouldn&#39;t I use it for smart-phones as well?</h3>
<p>The Desktop and Tablet controls aren&#39;t currently suited for small screens. Grids, trees,
panels, border layouts just require more room for proper display.  It may work, but it
isn&#39;t exactly suitable for smaller screens.</p>
<p>With Ext JS 6, you can author a single, universal application optimized to run on 
destktop, tablet, and phone devices.  The application may contain common event handling 
logic, stores, and models.  The views used will be pulled from the classic toolkit 
(<em>legacy Ext JS</em>) and the modern toolkit (<em>legacy Sencha Touch</em>) depending on which 
device  profile you&#39;re targeting.  You can read more about he universal app setup in the 
<a href="./getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_can_we_share_controllers_stores_models_between_extjs_5_and_touch_">How can we share controllers, stores, models between ExtJs 5 and Touch?</h3>
<p>Ext JS 5 and Sencha Touch are not optimized to share controllers, stores, and models.<br>However, they are shared between the modern and classic toolkits (<em>Touch and 
legacy Ext JS views respecively</em>) in Ext JS 6.  Refer to the 
<a href="./getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a> for additional information.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_can_i_see_what_changed_between_versions_">How can I see what changed between versions?</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We believe developers can glean a lot of useful information by evaluating 
these diff guides when upgrading their applications. That said, these reports are automated 
and may not always accurately depict change. Unwanted change may be 
indicated due to doc updates, formatting omissions, etc.  If you see anything in these reports 
that is incorrect or undesirable, please report them on the forums.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_does_ext_js_5_render_tables_faster_than_extjs_4_is_the_performance_improved_">Does Ext JS 5 render tables faster than ExtJS 4? Is the performance improved?</h3>
<p>It is faster in some areas.  Grid markup was changed in version 5 to use a 
table-per-row, which makes grid rendering significantly faster.  </p>
<p>JS layout for form fields and buttons was eliminated in favor of &quot;liquid&quot; CSS layout.
Performance improvements have been seen when using the &quot;form layout&quot; when producing 
large forms.  These types of improvements should help with performance, but there is 
still work to be done.  You can expect further performance improvements in the next 
release.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_is_it_possible_to_use_two_different_versions_of_ext_js_at_same_time_">Is it possible to use two different versions of Ext JS at same time?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can use a &quot;sandboxed&quot; build, which changes the top level JS namespace, and the 
CSS prefix to avoid conflicts.  It is important to note that it is not recommended to 
sandbox two different versions in a production environment as this entails loading two 
full versions of the Ext JS framework.  </p>
<p>This means that you&#39;d be loading twice as many resources as a typical &quot;non-sandboxed&quot;
application.  Sandbox builds are generally used for migration or for a temporary need to
include new features in an old application.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_should_we_utilize_localization_in_ext_js_5_">How should we utilize localization in Ext JS 5?</h3>
<p>Adding localization to your application is possible via locale-specific overrides, which
can be set in your Sencha Cmd generated <code>app.json</code> file.  Please see the 
<a href="../core_concepts/localization.html">localization guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_should_i_override_a_method_without_editing_the_source_code_">How should I override a method without editing the source code?</h3>
<p>The preferred way to create an override is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.overrides.panel.Panel&#39;, {
    override: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    close: function() {
        console.log(&#39;My Change to Close&#39;);
        this.callParent();
    },
    helloWorld: function(){
       console.log(&#39;Hello World&#39;);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>1)  First, define your override with an appropriate namespace for your application&#39;s
overrides folder</p>
<p>2)  Add the &quot;override&quot; config and give it a value equivalent to the class you are 
wanting to override.  In this example, we&#39;re overriding [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]].</p>
<p>3)  Add the function you&#39;re looking to override.  You&#39;ll need to make sure you keep all 
of the relevant pieces.  In this case, I&#39;ve only changed the close function by adding a
<code>console.log()</code>.  If you were to create a panel and then do <code>panel.close()</code>, you will 
receive a console message saying, &quot;My Change to Close&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In your overridden method you will need to execute <code>this.callParent()</code> to call 
the original method provided by the target class. To bypass that method and instead skip 
up to the superclass implementation (say to avoid a bug in the target class&#39;s method) 
you can invoke <code>this.callSuper()</code> instead.</p>
<p>4)  Add a new function all together.  As you may imagine, [[ext:Ext.panel.Panel]] does 
not contain a <code>helloWorld</code> method.  However, I&#39;ve just added it via this override.  Now, 
creating a panel and issuing <code>panel.helloWorld()</code> will result in logging the message 
&quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_how_do_i_use_the_draw_classes_in_5_">How do I use the Draw classes in 5?</h3>
<p>The draw package is now included in the sencha-charts package.  That said, you&#39;ll need 
to include sencha charts in order to utilize draw classes (or sencha charts).  </p>
<p>If you&#39;re using Sencha Cmd, this is as simple as adding &quot;sencha-charts&quot; to the requires
array in your <code>app.json</code> file.  </p>
<h2 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_using_sencha_charts_and_draw_without_sencha_cmd">Using Sencha Charts and Draw without Sencha Cmd</h2>
<p>If you want to use charts, but do not want to use Sencha Cmd, you may simply add the 
following inclusions to your app&#39;s &quot;index.html&quot; page in Ext JS 5.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;{ExtJS-5-SDK}/build/packages/sencha-charts/build/sencha-charts.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;{ExtJS-5-SDK}/build/packages/sencha-charts/build/classic/resources/sencha-charts-all.css&quot;&gt;
</code></pre><p>In Ext JS 6 using the classic toolkit:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;{ExtJS-6-SDK}/build/packages/charts/classic/charts.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;{ExtJS-6-SDK}/build/packages/charts/classic/classic/resources/charts-all.css&quot;&gt;
</code></pre><p>In Ext JS 6 using the modern toolkit:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;{ExtJS-6-SDK}/build/packages/charts/modern/charts.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;{ExtJS-6-SDK}/build/packages/charts/modern/modern-neptune/resources/charts-all.css&quot;&gt;
</code></pre><h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_does_the_framework_support_browser_zoom_">Does the framework support browser zoom?</h3>
<p>We do not officially support browser zoom, but most components will work as expected in
modern browsers.</p>
<h3 id="getting_started-_-extjs_faq_-_what_is_callparent_and_why_how_should_i_use_it_">What is callParent and why/how should I use it?</h3>
<p><code>callParent</code> is a method provided by the 
<a href="../core_concepts/classes.html">Sencha Class System</a> that is used to call methods in 
your parent / ancestor class. This is commonly done when you derive from a framework 
class and override a method it provides such as <code>onRender</code>. When you invoke <code>callParent</code> 
from a method that has parameters, you have two ways you can pass along those
parameters to the ancestor class method.  The best practice method is to utilize only 
the parameters that you specifically need.  In that case, you can pass these arguments 
in an array literal:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;App.view.MyPanel&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    onRender: function (parentNode, index) {
        this.callParent([ parentNode, index ]);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>Or, you could use the shorthand arguments keyword like so:</p>
<pre><code>Ext.define(&#39;App.view.MyPanel&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    onRender: function (parentNode, index) {
        this.callParent(arguments);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The differences may seem minor, but when you use the Sencha Cmd 5 new optimizations for
<code>callParent</code>, performance improvements can be profound. With the optimizer enabled, these
two methods are optimized as follows:</p>
<pre><code>onRender: function (parentNode, index) {
    Ext.panel.Panel.prototype.onRender.apply(this, arguments);
}
</code></pre><p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>onRender: function (parentNode, index) {
    Ext.panel.Panel.prototype.onRender.call(this, parentNode, index);
}
</code></pre><p>In the second case, the optimizer is able to use the call method on the JavaScript 
Function instead of apply. We also avoid using arguments. Both of which are well-known 
high performance no-no&#39;s. It turns out that we even avoid creating the array literal. 
Obviously, just enabling the optimization is helpful, but in code where performance is 
most critical, it is worth replacing arguments with the explicit array.</p>
